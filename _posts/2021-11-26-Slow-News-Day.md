Last night, I finished work on the **RSH** logo. I just uploaded a bunch of logo concepts and alternative versions. For those interested in seeing my design process from start to finish -- you can see it all [here](../projects/RSH). 

And after I have my coffee break, I will go and work on a logo for a **science podcast**.
