Having worked with the guys before on different projects, I don't think the band whom commissioned me to design their logo, Pandemonial, will mind me sharing this. If for whatever reason they do, pretend you never saw this. OK? 

Anyway. Last night, I drafted a first raw logo: ![Pandemonial](..\assets\img\projects\proj-3\PandemonialSketch.jpg)

And any minute from now I'll send it to them for approval. But I'm thinking maybe I should do another one first. After all, having or providing options is always the best plan.

What should I try next? Perhaps something with lowercase letters? And with a blackletter feel? Or is that too predictable?
