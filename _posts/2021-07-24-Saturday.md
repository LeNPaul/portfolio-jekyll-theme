title: "Paper Update"

Today I spent the entire day working on a companion website for a conference paper submission, mostly writing tongue-in-cheek comments to accompany a set of representative genre logos (the latter will be included in the paper). I hope to be able to share this and the paper results with you in a few weeks or so.
