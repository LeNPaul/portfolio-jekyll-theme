title: "A New Hope"

In case you were wondering, I'm still alive and well. But much has changed during the past two years -- too much to recite here. But the short of it is that in the span of two years, life as I knew it has changed dramatically. What happened is, my wife got pregnant and gave birth to my son. And with that change has come a shift in priorities and a focus away from metal designs to other creative outlets like comic art and 3D modelling. 

### Consolation
That being said, I've still done some work for metal bands. I did a logo (redesign) and T-shirt design for **Consolation**, a deathgrind band from the Netherlands (feat. members of Nembrionic, Unlord, and Cardinal).
