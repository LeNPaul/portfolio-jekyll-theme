All right. I just got the go ahead from **Pandemonial**. The sketch (below) was approved, so now I can start working my magic.

In other news ...

I attended <a href="https://www.facebook.com/beyondthegatesbergen" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>**Beyond the Gates**</span></a> this weekend. It's an annual black metal-festival held in Bergen, the cradle of Norwegian black metal. (Don't worry. It was all very corona-friendly, with a somewhat limited number of people attending, mandatory mask wearing, etc.) It was my first festival experience since this whole pandemic started -- and it was my first taste of normality since I don't know how long, or it felt like that to me. And it has reinvigorated me indescribably! Feels like I can take on the world again and accomplish just about anything ... except maybe establish an online presence. 


On that note, I just read this article at The Guardian about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/aug/08/instagram-artists-leaving-social-media-tiktok-shopping" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>the death knell of Instagram's creatives</span></a>. It's a sad story -- but all too true!  

Right now, I'm contemplating making the switch from Instagram to Artfol, though I don't know what good it'll do. But I suppose it's always worth the experiment. Maybe I should create a profile and monitor the analytics of my site traffic, and blog about it later ... Maybe I just need to focus on putting out more content.
