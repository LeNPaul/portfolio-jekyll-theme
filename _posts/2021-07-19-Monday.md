I don't have much news to report, except that I'm trying to *not* "break the chain" by blogging every day for a week, a month, or however long. Let's see how far it will go. 

Today I plan to finish or at least make some headway with that logo I mentioned yesterday.

What's new this time is that I've been taking notes every step of the way. So by the end I should be able to offer my readers (if I have any) a tutorial of sorts. No one asked for it, but I think it could be fun. Perhaps, maybe, I don't know, you tell me ...
