It seems I haven't blogged in over a month. It's because I was so swamped I didn't have much time nor inclination to blog. In the past two weeks alone I spent about 50 hours recording and editing a conference video presentation. Additionally, I spent a few too many hours of my spare time designing conference-themed logos like the one below.

Here you can the sketching process --

In the video, I'll also be showing for the first time a very special logo that I've been dying to show to the world! It's one that I made a year-and-a-half ago, but I was asked by the band to not reveal it to the public until a record deal was in the works, which is now the case. Here's a little teaser.

Anyway. If you're interested in seeing the video, you can tune in on Sunday to the <a href="https://altvis.github.io/" target="_blank">alt.VIS workshop</a> at **IEEE VIS 2021**. The last time I checked -- which was last night --, registration for the conference was still open. Alternatively, you can wait a week or so until I get the go ahead to share the video on my own social media channels. 


So what else is new?

After a few weeks of going back and forth -- not continuously mind you --, I can finally say that the Pandemonial logo has been approved and is ready for sharing -- though technically I've already been sharing the hell out of it. 

If you want to get a glimpse of the iterative steps that illustrate my thinking and the creative imagination behind the logo, you know what to do:
