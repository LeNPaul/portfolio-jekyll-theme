title: "Fleshbound: Redux"

Last night I finished working on the logo redesign for **Fleshbound**. 

**Fleshbound** for those unfamiliar with the band, is a Death Metal side project of members of **Lord Belial**. I originally did a logo for them in late-2006, but the project got shelved before an album was released. It's one of those things; it happens to a lot of bands. But the guys seem now intent on breathing new life into it! So let's wait and see what happens. 

In the meantime, I'm happy with what I came up with. The linework/texture give it a bony and meaty look and it's all bound in webbing. I think it's pretty clever.
