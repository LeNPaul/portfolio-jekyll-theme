From time to time there are slow news days. Today's not one of them.

I just got some good news that was over a year in getting to me ...

About a year ago I created something not only complex and complicated, but quite probably the most eerie and visceral design I've ever done. In fact, I'd even go as far as to say it's the coolest thing I've ever created. 

And I just got the greenlight to share it in all its g(l)ory.

By the way, the band is called Vathr, and they have an album coming out in six months. And that's all I can say on it.
