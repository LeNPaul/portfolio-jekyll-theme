## Decisions for 2k17

I have outrageous number of passions and it is hard to find focus what is important deal of time. To clear out mind here I share publicly list of important subjects -

### OpenSource
It is a big deal, atleast for me. Many years and different technologies, I never concentrated fully on any project maybe because I got involved with something more important. But it's time to hit opensource, so I fould try to fit in this list : https://hackernoon.com/top-6-open-source-projects-in-2017-db34b9d034a2

1. [Tensorflow](!https://www.tensorflow.org/)
2. [HyperLedger](!https://www.hyperledger.org/)
3. [React Native](!https://facebook.github.io/react-native/showcase.html)
4. [Kubernetes](!http://kubernetes.io/)
5. [Lab41](!http://www.lab41.org/about/)
6. [Vault](!https://www.vaultproject.io/intro/index.html)

### Competitive Programming
Mainly doing interviewbit, it would be long journey for me. Other than interviewbit I would focus on quality profiles for [spoj](!http://www.spoj.com/users/nithmanoj/), [codeforces](!http://codeforces.com/profile/nithmanoj) and [topcoder](!https://www.topcoder.com/members/nithmanoj). Apart of it I am getting interest in [Kaggle](!https://www.kaggle.com/nithmanoj).

Apart from this Computer science subjects, business & economics, books & biographies are going to consume my time. Ping me if anything goes interesting around you.
