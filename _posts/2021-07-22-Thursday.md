title: "Today's Debate"

Last night I more or less finished a first version of the **Pandemonial** logo. But something feels off and I can't put my finger on it. Now I'm debating whether to redraw some letters or to start all over again, from scratch. The problem with these things is that making little changes to one letter can have a cascading effect over other letters, potentially throwing off the entire balance of the design which may have you spending an awful lot of valuable time trying to fix the whole mess; time you could've spent designing something new, something better ... Sigh.
