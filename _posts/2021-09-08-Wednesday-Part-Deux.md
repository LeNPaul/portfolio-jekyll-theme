title: "Illegible Semantics, Pt. II: Another Wasted Effort? Or a Watershed?"
---

After my wife tweeted about our paper, a number of people started checking out the genre guide that I worked on diligently ... It took me weeks to cover about 50(!) subgenres and microgenres of Heavy and Extreme Metal, but it seems like a wasted efforts. Because the only thing that people are interested in is Black Metal and Porngrind. (So, which one of you is the pervert?)
