Talk about your blast from the past!

I haven't seen or heard from the guys of **Lord Belial** in about fifteen long years -- until today, that is. 

The Backelin brothers just reached out to me ... 

Back in 2006, I worked on a logo for their death metal side-project, **Fleshbound**. It seems like they're intent on breathing new life into the band, and with that they need a "print ready" version of the logo I did so many years ago.

Needless to say, I offered to them to redesign it or touch it up at least, for nostalgia's sake. 

Should be fun!
