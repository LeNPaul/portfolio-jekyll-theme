title: "The Year in Review"
---

It's been a trying year in many ways ... probably the most unsatisfactory year in more than a decade. Certainly from where I'm sitting. But not all has been bad. 

### Logos
This year I've had the pleasure of working with some amazingly talented people -- creating some pretty cool logos for some pretty neat artists and bands such as **Vathr**, who will put out an EP sometime early next year, **Fleshbound**, which features members from **Lord Belial**, and **Pandemonial**, a band that promises to take black metal back to its origins. 

But that's business as usual.

Perhaps more interestingly, I also had the honor of co-authoring a paper on metal logos, which was accepted by and presented at the **alt.VIS** workshop at **IEEE VIS**, the premier forum for visualization research and technology.

This led me to doing a logo for **Everything Hertz**, a science podcast.

### Illustrations
Next year I plan to focus mostly on illustrative work, be it working on my own projects or for others. At least two things come to mind here. 

First, especially, I plan on working on a comic. Two comics, actually. One science-fiction, the other an action humor story.

Secondly, me and a friend have been talking about starting a little print-on-demand venture as a thing on the side. To that end I will be doing some stylish illustrations. 



### Discoveries
Though I've mostly listened to older, familiar music, I've discovered new artists. A few deserve a special mention here (and no, I'm not being sponsored). **DÃ¸dsengel**, **Light Field Reverie**, and **Mephorash** are some of the bands that I listen to on a daily basis. None of these has released an album this year, however; of those that *did*, the ones that have impressed me the most are **1914**, **Emptiness**, **Helheim**, **Necronautical**, and **Tribulation**.
