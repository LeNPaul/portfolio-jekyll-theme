title: "Pieter Post-Metal"

Welp! I did it ... again.

Today, I spent way, waaay too much time on my comprehensive genre guide. I can't helpt it -- I'm having too much fun doing what I'm doing. 

I did a whole bunch of these, and now I have close to 40 genres covered. 

On a different note ... 

As I was thinking of a title for this blog entry, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uukgYgflCE" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Postman Pat</span></a>
 came to mind. Back in the Netherlands, I grew up watching watching this animated series. But back then I never knew him as Postman Pat; only as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umV3Cd78H2U" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Pieter Post</span></a>. Which got me thinking, maybe I should do a cartoon about a Pieter Post-Metal. But now that I've realized he's called Postman Pat -- now it doesn't seem like such a good idea anymore. (Although ... Post-Metal Pat, maybe?)
