title: "A Major Tiny Site Update"

In other news ...

I've made a few minor changes to the site that hopefully improve the user experience -- mainly, I put an end to the infinite scroll.


I also decided to add an [additional page](../projects/proj-9) featuring twenty more logos that I've done over the years and, where applicable, added years-old blog posts that I've written on some of them.
