Time for another update ...

This week, I've been working on some projects of my own -- specifically on character designs for a Bronze Age-inspired sci-fi comic.

It's totally different from my work for bands -- and it's still very much an ongoing effort and work in progress, which is why I've been hesitant to share it here, but I'm happy with what I have so far, and I want to the world to know what I've been working on.

The story is shaping up nicely, too, if I do say so myself -- though omeone else will probably think the plot paper thin and laden with a plethora of clich√©d characters espousing ham-fisted dialogue. But that doesn't matter, at least *I'm* having fun writing it.
