#### Github, huh?
In the past few months I have been stealthily working on my drawing craft. I did some logos for some bands that I'm not at liberty to show just yet. I also did some writing and sketching, working on my own stuff. All in all I had precious little to blog about. 

But in the past few weeks I've been working on a science paper, together with a crack team of computer scientists from around the world (including four professors, one of whom is my wife, and two PhDs). And this is actually pretty interesting stuff and blog-worthy even! Unfortunately, I can't divulge too much about it because it may well set the research agenda for years to come! Actually it's more that most of the things my paper collaborators talk about go over my head. I'm still waiting for the simplified, layman version, which should arrive soon, in a month, maybe two ...

At any rate, my wife feels the paper may boost my work and build my reputation when it (if it ever does) gets published. As a consequence, she's been pushing to me to put some of my work out (t)here ... She's right, though. It's been about damn. I should've started working on my online presence a long time ago.
