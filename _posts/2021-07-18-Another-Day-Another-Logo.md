title: "Another Day, Another Logo"
---
One day has passed since I launched my new website and already I got a new commission! I get to do a black metal logo for some known figures in the Bergen metal scene. 

I have no idea what their music sound like. (I'll probably be the last to get a taste of their music, as usual, but from what I've heard, it's supposed to really good.) But I like the name, and right now that's all that matters to me.
