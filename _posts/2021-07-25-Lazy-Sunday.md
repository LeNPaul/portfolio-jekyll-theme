Nothing much to report today. I did some more writing. The paper deadline is in five days, so it's all hands on deck.

I also got word that **Pandemonial** want me to take take the logo into another, completely different direction. Bit of a bummer. Luckily, I hadn't made too much headway yet.

Anyway. Tomorrow I'll see what else I can come up with.
