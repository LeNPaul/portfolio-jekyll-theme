Now, before you say anything, I know ... I'm obsessed. Sue me!

I worked some more on the companion website of the paper submission (on extreme metal logos), mostly adding some QoL-improvements, making it easier to navigate the site. I also wrote some more jokes and insights into extreme metal logo design.

I've put a lot of work into it, and I hope people will respond well to it. Or rather, I just hope people will respond to it -- at all. 

Anyway. Here's a sneak-preview of what's to come (from my side of things, at least) later this week.
