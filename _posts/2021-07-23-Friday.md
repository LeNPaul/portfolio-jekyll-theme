title: "Top 5-25-Who's Counting?"
---
As you may or probably may not know, I'm contributing to a paper that will be submitted to a conference in a week or so. It's about metal logos and their design characteristics -- but more about that later, perhaps. Right now I want to talk about this simple yet daunting special task one of my co-authors asked me to do -- to add my Top 5 songs to a collaborative playlist on Spotify, shared by all the paper co-authors -- all seven of us --, which will be shared at a later date on a companion website of the paper. *If*, or perhaps rather *when*, it gets published ... 

I am indeed quite optimistic about our chances. You would be too if you knew the people I'm working with. These guys (and one woman) are so smart and accomplished -- it's enough to make anyone feel like an *alazṓn*. I.e., an overconfident impostor. (I just learned that word myself, only minutes ago.)

Anyway. I somehow managed to narrow it down to 25 songs new and old, covering most of the music genres I listen to! Then came the difficult part -- to narrow it down further to just five. Well, I managed to do just that, but with pain in my heart. Which is why I decided to list the other 20 here (in alphabetic order). That's right, right here.
