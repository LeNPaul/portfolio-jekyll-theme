title: "Perilaxe Occlusion"
---

A friend of mine just suggested I check out <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/58G4TKwRpwoF4yRMosEnFY?si=jchMUrHcRZ6_gqF1LbitGw&dl_branch=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Perilaxe Occlusion</span></a>, a Canadian Death Metal band whose lyrics are largely about death ... and 3D modelling and rendering techniques. Pretty funny stuff really. (I'm not gonna lie I thought it would be another gimmick band, but they sound suprisingly good!)

What's funnier still is that I'm doing some 3D modelling right now -- early character and concept artwork for a comic book.
