We just submitted our alt.VIS paper. It's my first science paper submission -- ever. Regardless of acceptance or not, I'm proud to have contributed to science in my own peculiar way -- by doing 40 logos (and some writing) -- and I also deeply appreciate the privilege of having been able to work with some extremely smart metalheads from around the world (Germany, the UK, and the US). 

It's still all a bit surreal for me ...

Anyway. It means I can finally move on to doing other things -- like, creating more extreme metal art, I guess.
