title: "Mending the Chain"
---
It just dawned on me that I haven't updated my blog in the past few days. I had a good run but now the chain is broken. Oh well, it was bound to happen sooner or later anyway. And after last week's deadline crunch, I really needed a break from the computer. 

In about three, four weeks we'll know if our alt.VIS paper gets published or not. If not, we'll put it out somewhere ourselves. But that's for later. 

Today I'm concerning myself with practical matters again.

That's right. I'm back to designing a logo for **Pandemonial**. As requested, I'm trying a different approach -- that of doing something something more textured, but I'm not sure if it comes across. Probably not. Not yet, anyway. But obviously it's still a preliminary sketch, so things will become clearer as I go along.
