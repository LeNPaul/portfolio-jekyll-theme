title: "There's No School Like Old School!"

I've been working on some commissions lately. One of them is an **AC/DC**-like logo for a Bergen-based artist who's putting together an album that promises to be a return to old-school heavy metal. Maybe you've already seen it.

It's a simple, no-thrills logo, but it looks decent, and it allows for some cool 3D customization.
