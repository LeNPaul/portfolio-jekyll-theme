title: 'Cooley'
---

My friends and I wanted to play Dungeons and Dragons long distance, but there
was somewhat of a mobility issue since we would have to bring character sheets
and dice with us if we wanted to play. All of us had our Discord accounts, so
the idea of making a bot was born!

Built using C#, Cooley stores character sheets for users in JSON objects and
allows them to select whichever one they want to use. Most things on the D&D 5e
character sheets are accounted for, and commands to update or edit them.

Cooley was fun because he has so many commands available to really make the most
of the character sheets! He doesn't see so much action anymore, but his
repository can be found [here](https://www.github.com/zobiejrz/cooley).
