### Target Sketch 
Based on a napkin sketch based given to me by one of the band's members, I came up with this here logo.

### Conceptual Render
I then decided to try something new. I wanted to try and see if I could design a logo in 3D, so I could play with lighting and shadow methods.

The band wasn't feeling it to the point where I had to draft and finish the letters from scratch in 2D.

### Definitive Version
