Speed Metal has its roots in NWOBHM and would lay the foundation for later extreme metal genres. As the the name already suggests, it's all about *speed*. In this it's much like Thrash Metal -- which is probably why Speed logos can easily be mistaken for Thrash logos --, but it's lyrically less abrasive and musically more melodic. "But **Coroner** also play melodic things. And so do **Testament**." Yes. So what sets Speed logos apart from the rest? I'd say these, more than others, convey a **visual sense of speed**, which is why often the letters are designed in a **cursive style** and **drawn together in a single line**, or if not that at least **packed closely together**.
