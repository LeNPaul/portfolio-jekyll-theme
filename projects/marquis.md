> I was thinking of following up on my previous entry, explaining what I set out to with my latest cartoon. Instead, I decided on writing an update on what I’ve been doing lately.

> So what have I been up to? Well, I’m back to designing band art. Now, I can’t share everything — you know how it is, what with some bands wanting to reveal their logo or album cover in a special manner. But there’s stuff I can show you! Take this Marquis of Snakes logo, for example.

> On Twitter I jokingly remarked that I like my metal as I like my stilettos — **black** and **pointy**, much like a logo. The joke fell flat. (That’s Twitter for you!) But there is a truth to it. As much as I like soft, soothing music, I also like sharp and pointy black metal. Now, while I’m not as deeply entrenched in the black metal underground as I used to be — ever since I moved to Bergen, Norway, I find myself increasingly drawn to black metal again — which is also why, of course, I’m going to **Beyond the Gates** this August. What has any of this to do with the logo above?

> Well, I’ve been wanting to design a real, proper black metal logo for some time now — especially now that I live in a Norwegian town that is, basically, the capital of the black metal scene. You see, over the years, I’ve designed mostly death metal logos, and what few times I designed a black metal logo — it was probably a parody logo (see the **Hivernatum** logo below), so I’ve been lacking a good black metal piece for my portfolio. But that’s about to change. The **Marquis of Snakes** logo is going to be one hell of a logo — and I’m going to have it printed on a shirt so I can wear it to Beyond the Gates! I’ll be my own walking advertisement, and it will be great!

> So there’s that, but there’s more to the story. For instance, why Marquis of Snakes? I remember watching **The Conjuring 2**, the slightly disappointing sequel to — well, **The Conjuring**, and the only thing that really stuck out to me was the name of the film’s main antagonist — Valak, a demon whose title is — that’s right, you guessed it! — Marquis of Snakes. I figured I could turn it into a logo that genuinely screams “black metal,” and some initial sketching proved it a viable idea (see below).

> A few hours later I finished the lettering. And now — well, now I’m thinking of adding some more graphics to it, in order to take it to the next level. I’m not talking here of some goatheads or a winged Baphomet, or any other stuff that bear no congruence to the name and what it implies — no, I’m thinking snakes, a fallen cherub, or something like that. Whatever. Anyway, the logo should — probably, or at least hopefully — be finished sometime later this week. So stay tuned — because I’m sure it’ll be a lot more fun to look at it than watching **The Conjuring 2** in its entirety!

> Remember this Marquis of Snakes-logo I posted a few months ago? 

> Well, anyway, I was never really happy with how the letters turned out. So I decided to re-do them — from scratch. At the time of writing, I’m about half-way done (see below) — and it shows an improvement over the original lettering.

> Last time, I didn’t get around to adding all the graphics that I originally intended to add. This time however, I already went ahead with sketching the demon in the back of the logo (see below).

> I’m really looking forward to finishing this logo. And if you’re excited as I am to seeing this one finished — then stay tuned for future updates!

Then somehow I ended up with this in early 2018.
