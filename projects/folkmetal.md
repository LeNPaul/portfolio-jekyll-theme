Closely related to the Pagan Metal is Folk Metal. Where they differ is that while Pagan Black Metal still kinda has the cool factor of Black Metal, Folk Metal has little to no coolness at all, and this shows in the logos. They often take their inspiration from Black Metal aesthetics, with logos made of **lowercase blackletters** or some **Celtic type**, with only **some degree of symmetry** on both opposite ends of the logo, if at all, and even then usually through **decorative curls** rather than through cool letter design.

> **Update**: A friend of mine felt I was too harsh on Folk Metal, so I did what any scientist would do: I gave it another chance. I'm a scientist now, after all -- I mean, I did get a paper published. Anyway. Good science demands honesty. It demands that we suspend judgment until we know the facts. 

> Well now my friend, who is himself a talented musician, made a compelling argument that Folk Metal musicians are often or usually talented in what they do. Sadly, what they do is play Folk Metal. And that brings us back to where we started. A bit of a circular argument, I know, but can you blame me when all I see when I think of Folk Metal are circles and polka dots? In case the joke went over your head: **Finntroll**, one of the first Folk Metal bands to gain international notoriety, play what is often referred to as Polka Metal on account of them integrating *huumpa* (Finnish polka melodies) with Black Metal.

> The thing with Folk Metal is that it juxtaposes acoustic components, i.e. acoustic folk instruments such as violin, accordion, flute, bagpipe, and kantele, with the power and electronic distortion of Heavy Metal. Some people think it's cool and some people don't. (Actually, *most* people don't.) Music critic Scott Seward is one of the former. You ask him and he will tell you that contemporary folk "too often lack the fierceness and meatiness of music born from blood and fire and plague."<sup>15</sup> Meanwhile, listening to a Folk Metal band like **Korpiklaani** sends him "instantly back to a time when trolls ruled the woods." Well I got news for you, Scott. Trolls never ruled the woods. In fact, trolls never even existed! And you call yourself a critic? How about next time you do your due diligence and research your claims! It's what I did and, well -- it persuaded me that my bias was indeed correct. 

> I will say this much, if there's one thing you can count on it's that whoever is playing the accordion, or the violin, is probably a hot smoking babe. (Call me!)


### Folk Metal (Continued)
Some Folk bands take things to the next level by incorporating **viking helmets** and **drinking-horns** in their logos to signal to people, "When you come to our show, you're free to live out your viking fantasy vicariously. By all means, bring your plastic drinking-horn!" And why wouldn't you, if you're a fan of Folk Metal. You've already ostracized yourself from typical metalheads anyway, you may as well commit to the LARP thing.
