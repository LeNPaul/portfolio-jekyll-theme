These logos were all created for a paper called **'Illegible Semantics: Exploring the Design Space of Metal Logos'**, which was submitted to and accepted by **alt.VIS**, a workshop at **IEEE VIS**. The paper's about how Heavy and Extreme Metal logos tell a story -- even if it isn't always immediately apparent. It's true! Go see for yourself! It just takes one click. But if you want to first know more about the paper, go [here](#illegible).

# Illegible Semantics

#### Introduction
September 1, 2021

About a month ago, I, together with a crack team of scientists and researchers, submitted a paper called **Illegible Semantics: Exploring the Design Space of Metal Logos** to alt.VIS, a workshop at IEEE VIS, the premier forum for Visualization and Visual Analytics. Last night we got the news that it was accepted.

As you may surmise from the title, we explore the "design space" of Metal Logos in our paper; and when we say "Metal," we refer to Heavy Metal and its Extreme Metal subgenres -- and the subgenres within those. Each has its own visual aesthetics and codes that govern how logos can or should look like, generally. Here things can get weirdly specific. For example, bands in a genre often have the same kind of logos, but depending on subgenre, bands may have a different kind of logo, and a logo style can even depend on a given band's locality!

As you can imagine, it can get complicated fairly quickly when you're trying to get a handle on what's what and how things play out visually, concretely, and pratically -- especially if you're not in the know. In order to facilitate understanding, I created 40-something logos using the name of the conference (VIS), covering a broad range of genres and subgenres of Heavy and Extreme Metal music. Additionally, I've added some humorous, insightful, tongue-in-cheek commentary to give you some idea into the design process of each of these logos. 

#### The What and Especially the Why
What we did, and why we did it, is best explained in the paper, but the short of it is that with our paper (1) we offer a (multi-dimensional) framework to help characterize “illegible” band logos. (2) We also developed a webtool that is based on a machine learning approach that allows the user to explore a corpus of thousands of existing band logos that were scraped from Encyclopaedia Metallum and filter and group them based on certain characteristics such as genre, color, and “image-likeness.”

The main result of the paper is that we can now say that there is definitely more to designing extreme metal logos than just making them as unreadable as possible – there is a system to the madness: there is indeed a visual language in the logos. And following this we may even suggest that literal legibility – that is “legibility” understood in terms of clarity and efficiency – is not the be-all-end-all of textual information visualisation.

But it doesn’t end there. Over the past few weeks, I also worked on a fairly comprehensive genre guide for the paper’s companion on the web, featuring a ton of samples that have been “vetted” by scene veterans and a fellow-metal designer. I had much fun with it. And I sincerely believe that it can be of help to someone, which is why I added it to my website.


#### Full Disclosure
With these genre samples I tried to represent as faithfully as possible a broad range of genres, based on my own years of experience in designing Metal logos and studying up on genres that I'm not too familiar with. I then had them checked by several scene veterans and a fellow designer to confirm style accuracy and coverage. As of yet, some of these have not officially been checked and validated by the "field experts." But, ultimately, these remain interpretations, anyway. 

It may well be that you have other ideas on what these logos are supposed to look like. Maybe you don't think my comments are clever or helpful or funny. In that case, drop me a line on Twitter, and tell me what needs improving


#### Acknowledgements
I'd like to give a shoutout to everyone who helped me write this guide -- your insights and thoughts were much appreciated!
