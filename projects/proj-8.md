## Introduction
September 1, 2021

About a month ago, I, together with a crackteam of scientists and researchers, submitted a paper called **Illegible Semantics: Exploring the Design Space of Metal Logos** to alt.VIS, a workshop at IEEE VIS, the premier forum for Visualization and Visual Analytics. Last night we got the news that it was accepted.

As you may surmise from the title, we explore the "design space" of Metal Logos in our paper; and when we say "Metal," we refer to Heavy Metal and its Extreme Metal subgenres -- and the subgenres within those. Each has its own visual aesthetics and codes that govern how logos can or should look like, generally. Here things can get weirdly specific. For example, bands in a genre often have the same kind of logos, but depending on subgenre, bands may have a different kind of logo, and a logo style can even depend on a given band's locality!

As you can imagine, it can get complicated fairly quickly when you're trying to get a handle on what's what and how things play out visually, concretely, and pratically -- especially if you're not in the know. In order to facilitate understanding, I created 40-something logos using the name of the conference (VIS), covering a broad range of genres and subgenres of Heavy and Extreme Metal music. Additionally, I've added some humorous, insightful, tongue-in-cheek commentary to give you some idea into the design process of each of these logos.

#### Full Disclosure
With these genre samples I tried to represent as faithfully as possible a broad range of genres, based on my own years of experience in designing Metal logos and studying up on genres that I'm not too familiar with. I then had them checked by several scene veterans and a fellow designer to confirm style accuracy and coverage. As of yet, some of these have not officially been checked and validated by the "field experts." But, ultimately, these remain interpretations, anyway. 

It may well be that you have other ideas on what these logos are supposed to look like. Maybe you don't think my comments are clever or helpful or funny. In that case, drop me a line on Twitter, and tell me what needs improving

<a name="heavy"></a> 
# Heavy Metal
Heavy Metal music was birthed by a Birmingham band called **Black Sabbath** in the late 1960s and early 1970s. From its inception, it was criticized for being "violent, aggressive, dark, depressing, angry, and misogynistic," and rightly so, because it was outsider music for outsiders -- mostly young men who faced economic and personal hardship.<sup>1</sup> Little did people know then that things were to get only more and more extreme in every imaginable way. But it would take about two decades before Heavy Metal started to branch out in the evermore extreme subgenres of Thrash, Death, Doom, and Black Metal (these will be discussed below), because that's how long it took for Heavy Metal to enter the mainstream of music. Of course, once that happened, many felt that Heavy Metal had become too commercial and too popular. Indeed, by the mid- to late-1980s, Heavy Metal had lost much of its original bark; now it was time to make things insular again, which is to say doing something that is not appreciated by many, something different and out of the mainstream.


What this means for our purposes is that we're looking at two decades of design evolution. Which is why I struggled to find a quintessential example of a pure, Heavy Metal Rock logo that I could use as inspiration, because these types of logos are kinda all over the place style-wise, from (initial) **wordmark** (i.e. type-only) logos of 1970s Heavy Metal bands (**Black Sabbath**, **Judas Priest**, **Mot√∂rhead**, **Scorpions**) to the extremely diverse custom logos of 1980s Heavy Metal bands. The latter range from rough, sketchy logos (**Skid Row**) to airbrushed or painted designs (**Y&T**) to logos that have a "Saturday-morning cartoon" feel to them (**Danger Danger**).


But I'd say generally, as opposed to other the (sub)genres that we discuss in the paper, Heavy Metal logos take their cues from **biker** and ersatz **Nazi aesthetics** with sometimes **Runic motifs** and stereotypically have a **blocky feel to them**. They're also often **colorful in terms of hues and tinges**.

<a name="NWOBHM"></a> 
## NWOBHM
In the late-1970s and early-1980s, as the British Heavy Metal supergroups (**Black Sabbath**, **Deep Purple**, **Led Zeppelin**) that once were part of the anti-establishment, had now become part of the Establishment, a new wave of British Heavy Metal (NWOBHM) emerged all over Britain. As a genre, NWOBHM encompasses diverse mainstream and underground styles, but one thing that bands playing in this genre shared in common is that they drew inspiration from the anti-establishment punk movement of the late-1970s, producing fast and raw songs.

infusing it with the intensity of punk rock to produce fast and aggressive songs.

> "As the British metal supergroups of the Seventies, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple and Judas Priest among them, went to live in tax exile, so a new wave of British heavy metal emerged to satisfy the loyal fans' need for live music at grass-roots level."<sup>3</sup>

-->

With respect to NWOBHM logos, what was said earlier about Heavy Metal logos also applies here -- style-wise they're all over the place.

Here, I purposely decided to do a logo in the vein of those of **Iron Maiden** and **Judas Priest**, because I felt it'd make for an interesting comparison with specifically Teutonic (i.e. German) Thrash Metal logos, which can be found further down. The key words here: **industrial**, **tight**, and **laser-like**.

<a name="speed"></a> 
#### Speed Metal
Speed Metal has its roots in NWOBHM and would lay the foundation for later extreme metal genres. As the the name already suggests, it's all about *speed*. In this it's much like Thrash Metal -- which is probably why Speed logos can easily be mistaken for Thrash logos --, but it's lyrically less abrasive and musically more melodic. "But **Coroner** also play melodic things. And so do **Testament**." Yes. So what sets Speed logos apart from the rest? I'd say these, more than others, convey a **visual sense of speed**, which is why often the letters are designed in a **cursive style** and **drawn together in a single line**, or if not that at least **packed closely together**.

<a name="power"></a> 
#### Power Metal
Power Metal takes its inspiration from both "traditional" Heavy Metal and Speed Metal and fuses the elements therefrom with theatrics and bombast in an effort to create something emotionally impactful and powerful. (More often, however, the result is akin to Wagnerian *bathos*, which is no doubt the reason why Power Metal is only really popular in Germany and German-speaking Europe.) This may be why Power logos are often **rendered in full 3D**, with a **metallic** or **stony texture**. Because, you know, Power Metal is that deep and powerful! Like metal or stone!

<a name="symphonic"></a> 
#### Symphonic Metal
One subgenre that I originally couldn't be bothered with -- even though it is a major one -- is Symphonic Metal. This is an off-shoot genre of Power Metal, and thus shares much of its musical DNA with its parent genre. This linkage is also visible in some of the bands' names. These are often lifted from Power Metal songs. If a Symphonic Metal band is called Dragon-Fiddler, then it's likely a Power Metal band once put out a track called something along the lines of "Dewi's Mystical Hymne (The Scarlet Dragon-Fiddler)." 

Where Symphonic Metal bands differ from Power Metal bands is that the former put even more emphasis on the bombast, believing themselves to be following in the footsteps of scoring giants like John Williams and Hans Zimmer -- though they'd be lucky if they could do the score for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M0_9YcRDQ0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Uwe Boll</span></a> movie --, and they're more likely to be female-fronted; and if they aren't, then it still sounds like they are. 

It's generally easy to recognize Symphonic Metal bands from others. Nine out of ten bands have a **serif wordmark** with a **textured gradient fill** for a logo, with maybe one or two **customly elongated tails** -- making it look like someone sneezed while working on the letters; the tenth band, meanwhile, probably has a regular Power Metal logo. <!-- Oh, and if they play speedy music, the letters are probably in **cursive**. -->

<a name="glam"></a> 
## Glam Metal (a.k.a. Hair Metal)
In the late-1980s, when Heavy Metal was as mainstream as anything else on MTV (does anyone remember MTV?), the Heavy Metal movement began taking after the 1970s, specifically 1970s Glam Rock (**T. Rex**, **David Bowie**, **Alice Cooper**, **Queen**). Popular Heavy Metal artists started teasing their hair and applying girly make-up in an effort to look as androgynous as possible, and putting an emphasis on stagecraft over substance and authenticity. Today, no one would bat an eye, but these were the 1980s, after all, and many Metal fans were like, "This is getting way too poppy and wimpy," and we should all be grateful for that. If it wasn't for them -- fans and artists alike -- who knows if, say, the Black Metal scene would have emerged as it did -- with performers donning makeup and taking after the gay leather scene?<sup>4</sup>

Just don't tell them that. As poignantly pointed out by sociologists Ben Hutcherson and Ross Haenfler that though there is "empirical similarity between adoring oneself with corpse paint [which will be explained later below, G.] and applying eyeliner and mascare, [Extreme Metal] adherents define the two situations in drastically different ways."<sup>5</sup> A certain vocalist of a Bluff City Extreme (presumably Black) Metal Metal, band once said this in an interview that it's about being fucking evil: "We're up there [on stage] looking like horrific fuckin' beasts, with our gauntlets and goat skulls and shit ... it's not some bullshit put-on-your-mommy's-makeup gimmick." He was backed up by a drummer and veteran of the scene, who remarked that he himself had been "wearing corpse paint longer than most of these girl-pants-wearing f_____s [censored by me, G.] have been goin' through their mom's or sister's makeup kit."

But at any rate, Glam Metal lost its mainstream appeal in the 1990s, mostly due to the rise of Grunge -- though some early pioneers of the genre (**M√∂tley Cr√ºe**, **Poison**, **Ratt**) are still active and some new ones have formed (**The Darkness**, **Reckless Love**, **Steel Panther**).

In terms of letter design and style, Glam logos come in all sorts of types and shapes, but as a general rule they tend to be girly and brightly colored, which is by no means a bad thing. They're just not particularly extreme and insular in design.


<!--You know, 'cause donning makeup is cool and totally not girly. (You may laugh, but it's true. Some Tennessee Black Metal singer once said this in an interview: "It's about being fucking evil. We're up there [on stage] looking like horrific fuckin' beasts, with our gauntlets and goat skulls and shit ... it's not some bullshit put-on-your-mommy's-makeup gimmick." He was backed up by another who remarked that he was wearing corpse paint longer than most of these girl-pants-wearing faggots have been goin' through their mom's or sisters' makeup kit.")

<a name="thrash"></a> 
# Thrash Metal
Abrasive. Loud. Extremely fast yet still precise, with impeccable sense of timing. If judging by these words alone, it may sound like I'm describing a Dutch olympian -- a speed skater or a cyclist, perhaps. But we're talking music, aren't we? I'm talking Thrash Metal, of course, which means I'm talking yet another extreme subgenre of Heavy Metal. 

Oh, and yes, it's "Thrash," not "Trash." Though some bands in this and adjacent genres are absolutely, undeniably, unapolgetically trash. (Thrashcore, anyone?)

As a scene, it emerged simultaneously in different parts of the world, in different countries (Britain, Germany, Latin America, and the US), from where it developed out of different genres (most notably NWOBHM and Punk Hardcore). This is why there is a variety of styles within the Thrash genre -- one that is in large part determined by bands' locality. 

Of course, Thrash Metal has its own aesthetics, too. Generally speaking, Thrash logos tend to have **straight, sharp edges** that reflect the tightness and controlled nature of the music's rhythms.<sup>6</sup> (You know, tight and controlled ... like a murderer carving their name in a victim's chest.<sup>7</sup>) Indeed, some exceptions aside, there is no softness to be found in them whatsoever -- there is only hardness.

<a name="usthrash"></a> 
## US Thrash

It can be difficult to differentiate between a US Thrash band and a German one; perhaps the only clue is that US Thrash logos are more likely to have hints or elements of **symmetry** (because Americans love symmetry in all things except the balance of power) and **interconnectedness** to them. Come to think of it, they may also have more likelihood of having an **outline** or **"halo"** surrounding the letters.

<a name="bay"></a> 
#### Bay Area Thrash
If we are to distinguish further among US Thrash Metal bands and we continue differentiating, then the early-1980s San Francisco Bay Area scene surely deserves some attention from everyone! What's interesting here is that the aesthetics of said scene were largely characterized by a "do-it-yourself" ethos, as opposed to the aesthetics of the then already established Metal bands who often used established fonts for their logos (see **Iron Maiden**, for example). Arguably the most famous example of this is **Metallica**'s logo that was drawn up by none other than James Hetfield himself. This may be why certain US Thrash logos, or part of these logos, **look a bit off**; because they were not always done by trained graphic designers who are familiar with rulers and with drawing and measuring segments.

![Bay Area Thrash](..\assets\img\projects\proj-8\bay.jpg)

Another thing to point out here is that in Bay Area Thrash logos you can often find a **juxtaposition of straight lines with round shapes** or **straight lines against curved lines**. To refer back to the example of Metallica's logo, the C is rounded, but the first and last letters are sharp and italicized.

## Teutonic Thrash 
As a genre, Teutonic Thrash Metal has a distinct German character, and a few notable exceptions aside, this is reflected in the kind of logos bands in this genre have. Like 1980s US Thrash logos, Teutonic Thrash logos are **extremely angular, with fixed angles**, but with **less emphasis on symmetry**, and the letters are generally **more blocky in shape**. With this, German Thrashers seem to be saying, "We believe in robustness over sophistication, and function over form." Which is all fine and dandy until you try to put a cube through a round hole. It's probably why you've never heard of **Kreator** ... while you no doubt own a copy of the **"Black"** album.

<a name="groove"></a> 
#### Groove Metal
Groove Metal is an off-shoot of Thrash. The riffs are thrashy, but the tempos are slower -- down from 200 to a more danceable 135 beats-per-minutes on average. Of course this all relative, since I've danced to **Emperor**'s "With Strength I Burn" that clocks in at 167 BPM; but you won't ever catch me dancing to, say, **Pantera**'s "Cowboys from Hell" that clocks in at only 115 BPM. 

Because Groove Metal is a softened-up version of Thrash, it's only obvious that bands in this genre have a "softer" logo. And what is softer than a metal? Exactly -- wood. So I gave this one a **wooden finish**. (Honestly, I had no idea what I was supposed to do with Groove Metal. So I took some cues from Pantera and White Zombie and this is what it resulted in.)

# Death Metal
Death Metal at large is one of the major "mainstream" modes of Extreme Metal. It's typically characterized by low-tuned, heavily distorted guitars, aggressive, thumping drumming (featuring double-kicks and blast-beats), deep growling vocals, abrupt and complex changes in tempo and time signature ... As a genre, it is very broad, encompassing a great deal of diversity. Indeed, it has spawned several subgenres since its inception in the mid- to late-1980s, all with their own specific iconography. Here I will be covering only some of them. 

As a general rule it can be observed that in this genre the letters making up the logos tend to be **thick** and **bold** as opposed to, say, the letters making up Black Metal logos. The latter tend to be thin and sometimes somewhat shaky. In that these logos strikingly resemble the fans of these respective genres who are generally respectively heavy set characters and lanky, out-of-sorts pushovers. 

And, contrary to Thrash Metal logos, Death Metal logos tend to have more **"soft" elements**. This, too, makes perfect sense. Thrash gives its fans a linear, myopic view on life in general: it's all about alienation and oppression from a threatening, hostile world of authority -- yet it offers nothing helpful in way of unburdening; meanwhile, ironically, Death offers a more rounded approach to life -- offering a safe, routinized way of exploring things that would terrify or disgust most, which enables a cathartic dissipation of everyday's tension.<sup>8</sup> (I'm not gonna lie -- I really didn't expect to find a source to kinda back this up.)

<a name="brutal"></a> 
## Brutal Death
Brutal Death Metal emerged most notably from the 1980s New York Hardcore movement. It's characterized by its thumping heaviness, high-speed power chording and riffing, and overall complex rhythms. As a rule, their lyrics deal with slasher movies and True Crime, and this is often reflected in their choice of logos. These typically incorporate **gore elements** (e.g., bones, intestines, and blood), sometimes to the point where the entire logo exactly resembles a jigsaw puzzle of bones dripping blood.

<a name="florida"></a> 
#### Florida Death Metal
When it comes to Death Metal, the Florida Death Metal scene deserves some special attention. Here the bands that emerged in the late-1980s were not so much inspired by the Hardcore movement but rather built on the musical formula established by early-1980s Thrash Metal and the first wave of Black Metal bands. These Florida bands were also lyrically more inspired, expressly refined, dealing with more abstract concepts such as religion, enlightenment, and ecology. 

In terms of logo design, it's hard to pinpoint specific characteristics. Perhaps significantly, perhaps coincidentally, I'd say, on the whole, these logos tend to have a "tattoo-like," "hellfirish" quality to them (think here of **tribal flames** with their scythe-like edges or 1950s-style **hotrod flames**).

<a name="melodic"></a> 
## Melodic Death Metal
Melodic Death Metal was arguably first pioneered in the United Kingdom, but the genre really came into its own in Sweden, specifically in Gothenburg. As a genre, it took its inspiration from a wide range of styles, from Death Metal to NWOBHM to Progressive Rock, with certain elements from these reference styles more predominant in one band's music than another's, which may help explain why it's difficult to think of a quintessential Melodic Death logo. 

Initially, indeed, in the early 1990s, Melodic Death logos were very diverse in style, with some (seemingly) taking their inspiration from "mainstream" Death Metal logos (**In Flames**), others had intricate custom designs (**At the Gates**), while still others opted for a distorted and deformed Celtic type (**Dark Tranquillity**). In later and more recent years, however, most bands in this genre have **highly-readable wordmarks** that are sometimes "touched up" or "filled in" with a **dirt brush**. 

Looking at the history of some of these bands, it kinda makes perfect sense. Take **In Flames**, for example. In the early-1990s, they were amongst the first to pioneer Melodic Death Metal, releasing their first two albums with a fiery red Death Metal-inspired logo with a keyline detail. Then, in the late 1990s, they changed their style towards a more general melodic sound, which had them change their logo to a (seemingly) unmodified, cursive wordmark. A few years later, they dipped their toes in the Metalcore craze of the mid-2000s, releasing some albums with a non-cursive wordmark. And, more recently, they seem to have settled down for an "alternative" sound, which had them change logos yet again ... If a band changes styles more often than I change my underwear, it makes no sense to commit to an ephemeral genre logo; hence probably the choice for a basic logo.

<!--
![Melodic Death Metal](https://viralviralvideos.com/wp-content/uploads/GIF/2015/08/Youre-basic-GIF.gif)
-->

**In Flames** are not an isolated example; **Amorphis**, **At the Gates**, **Carcass**, **Dark Tranquillity**, **Hypocrisy** -- basically all the major bands in this genre have "gone basic" at some point in their career -- some permanently, some only momentarily.

<a name="tech"></a> 
## Technical Death Metal
A hard-and-fast rule in Death Metal aesthetics is that the more technical the music, the less sophisticated the logo. This is exemplified in Technical Death Metal, a genre whose musicians and artists mix "fast, virtuosic guitar riffs and solos of varying tempos and time signature changes with prevalent drumming and frequent blast beats."<sup>9</sup> It's like they opt to convey an impression of modesty (or perhaps false modesty), often leading to conversations like this:

- "I can play with my eyes closed!"
- "Cool! But did you also have to do that logo with your eyes closed?"

It is worthwhile pointing out here that you can often place a band in this genre somewhere in time just by looking at the band's logo. In the 1990s and before, Tech Death bands had "analogously" hand-drawn logos; post-2000s, these logos have been done mostly digitally -- and it shows.

#### 1990s Tech Death
Logo-wise, it's usually easy to recognize 1990s bands playing in this genre. They often have what **looks like a Black Metal logo**, except it's not -- it's **not nearly as sophisticated**.
![Technical Death Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-8\tech90.jpg)
If they're still active to this day, they now probably have a **type-only logo**, one that is most likely **superimposed** over an earlier "Black Metal-like" logo.

#### Post-2000s Tech Death
It's fairly easy to recognize a post-2000s Technical Death band from a 1990s band in the same genre. For some reason wholly unknown to me, the former is likely to have a logo that they proudly put on their shirts -- even though it doesn't really look good. It's always like these logos were done by a novice who played with **Illustrator** and who is not quite familiar yet with Illustrator's **Pen tool**. The result inevitably is that all these logos have a **"B√©zier" look** to them; and this is the reason they *never* look good.

#### Rasterized Death Metal
We all have these moments where we think why not supplement one hobby with another. It's what I did when I realised that 2D and 3D drawing and modelling are not mutually exclusive but in fact are perfectly complementary: using Blender I now often produce models and renders as reference for my drawings. But anyway as it turns out, so too are 3D modelling and making Death Metal. This is proven by **Perilaxe Occlusion**, the only Death Metal band whose lyrics are largely about death and image-based modeling and rendering techniques, because why not? If **Nile** are allowed to write, sing, and nerd about <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/62hzJcOwMg68h6wBimZALA?si=1622e1b4ecef4422" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Egyptian history and mythology</span></a> to their heart's content, if **Fleshgod Apocalypse** are allowed to indite <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3sizVMerlajPegOZWbMKwZ?si=b6fcada8a8c549d3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>a pompous pseudo-intellectual love letter to Greek mythology</span></a>, and if **Carach Angren** are allowed to write lyrics about <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/22mLxdBxBzLAC65fPirK2k?si=8fcb4261bb854615" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>a girl who hastily throws a piece of pie in a plastic bag</span></a>, then anyone can sing about anything at all!

Just by looking at their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CGas6abpA70/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Instagram</span></a>, we can see what went into the making of a Rasterized Death logo. Spoiler alert: it's basically a plain "hollowed out" Death Metal logo covered in webs, drips and yes, polygonal wireframes, because again why not? If you have a gimmick, make sure to use it. Like **Fleshgod Apocalypse** -- if you got a vocalist who can sing a falsetto, you really want him to shove his voice through a mean falsetto on every damn song because that's what the fans want. (No, they don't -- they really don't, so just put a lid on it!)

<a name="progressive"></a> 
## Progressive Metal
What does "Progressive" mean in the context of Metal? Who knows? I sure as hell don't. It could mean anything from "We brought in a saxophonist to record a Metal album with us" to a more general "We march to our own beat" -- which is often to be taken literally: Progressive bands seem to have a weird thing for *syncopation*. 

The question then is how to best represent this visually? It may seem daunting but it is actually quite easy: (1) the letters need to be **tight and bold** and (2) the letters need to be **missing parts**, because this says something about the band's music: "Our music is tight and bold! And it's often difficult to follow and may even end abruptly."

#### Djent
Djent. I know it's a spin-off from Progressive Metal; but what is it, really? Literally no one knows. But you know what it is when you hear it. (*The drumming starts off slow, then accelerates in bursts.* Padummm dum dum doom! padummm dum dum doom! *Shortly after, the singer's whiny vocals kick in ...*) And unless you're a Metal Hipster, you probably won't like it. Indeed, it is one of two genres that attracts a high proportion of Hipsters. You probably never heard of the other one. You haven't -- it's so underground, it's not even "indie."

Djent logos are often deluged with "coffee stains." This is not necessarily a conscious design choice. It's simply because a lotta accidents happen when you spend your time writing songs in an independent urban coffee bar.

# Grindcore
Grindcore is one of the heavier microgenres. It fuses elements of Thrash and Death as well as Crust and Hardcore, and does away with things like standard time signatures, creating a negative synergy where one plus one usually equals less than two. No wonder, then, that Grindcore logos look **crude and unfinished** at best. But all is not bad either, for great (to some) is the genre's fondness for puerile humor and disgusting aesthetics, with **visual references to scathology** and **other bodily functions**. In short, think of Grindcore aesthetics as the typographic equivalent of a schoolboy's fantasies. This may also help explain the heavy usage of **color** and **texture**. Kids love color. Right? I wouldn't know, I'm not a father. I'm also not a Grindcore expert. Luckily, I know someone who *is*.

Melle Gerritsen, Grindcore fan extraordinaire, has this to say:

> (*In part translated and in part parahrased*): "Grindcore sucks, and all the fans know it. The sum is less than its parts -- and covered in excrement."

## Porngrind (short for "Pornogrind")
***TMI WARNING!!!*** 

This warning may be a bit late in the guide, but you should use caution in allowing your youngsters or colleagues to see you reading this.

Some people suggested I should add some distinct subgenres of Grindcore. There are quite a few, such as Goregrind (**Cliteater**, **Haemorrhage**, **General Surgery**) and Cybergrind (**Cutting Pink with Knives**, **Genghis Tron**, **iamerror**), but here I'll focus only on Porngrind, a microgenre that is fixated on, as you may have already surmised, pornographic lyrical themes. 

Understand that the reason I picked this one out is only because I've already had the dubious honor of doing a Porngrind logo years ago (don't ask!) and I was able to use that one as a base to draw upon. I think the logo speaks for itself so that I need not elaborate on it.

*Due to the graphic NSFW nature of the sample logo, we thought it best to **not** display the sample logo in full-frame view, but for those interested, you can see it* <a href="..\assets\img\projects\proj-8\porngrind.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>*here*</span></a>.

It's a genre so base and vile, you won't be able to find most bands on Spotify. Luckily, there's still Youtube ...

# Black Metal
Black Metal as we know it now is one of the more extreme subgenres of Heavy Metal music, not just in terms of music but equally in terms of commitment and attitude. It gets its name from the 1982 album *Black Metal* by the NWOBHM band **Venom**. But as a genre it owes its inception and its collective debt to two distinct successive waves of bands in the mid-1980s and the early-1990s. The first wave consisted of mostly European but also Canadian and Japanese bands (**Bulldozer**, **Blasphemy**, **Sabbat**) who mostly played fast thrashy stuff, while "singing about Satan and demons and all the dark forces" and donning leather, spikes, and bullet belts for stage shows "to create a dark, ominous, evil atmosphere."<sup>10</sup> For them, Black Metal, insofar as they used the term at all, and its Satanic subject matter were just that: a subversive, tongue-in-cheek theme to shock -- not a genre, nor a style. Then came the second wave, which consisted of bands from especially Norway (**Burzum**, **Darkthrone**, **Mayhem**). They took things to a whole new level. For many of them, Black Metal was a distinct genre, one which demanded commitment to a certain sound, but even more so it was also a way of life (to some at least) -- a life of devil worship.<sup>11</sup>

Indeed, when it comes to Norwegian Black Metal, artists and fans alike went to the extremes of the extreme, committing acts of self-maiming, suicide, arson, grave-robbing, and in some cases even murder; though these days it's really just another music genre that's out there. But back in the day late-1980s and 1990s, it was almost a secret society; and members didn't want their identities exposed, which is part of the reason why Norwegian Black Metal performers often covered their faces with black-and-white "corpse paint," "creating monstrous or ghoulish skull-like visages using stage makeup, Halloween-themed makeup, and even shoe polish."<sup>12</sup> <!--You know, 'cause donning makeup is cool and totally not girly. (You may laugh, but it's true. Some Tennessee Black Metal singer once said this in an interview: "It's about being fucking evil. We're up there [on stage] looking like horrific fuckin' beasts, with our gauntlets and goat skulls and shit ... it's not some bullshit put-on-your-mommy's-makeup gimmick." He was backed up by another who remarked that he was wearing corpse paint longer than most of these girl-pants-wearing faggots have been goin' through their mom's or sisters' makeup kit.") But at any rate, --> The other part was to "be the visual expression of the content of their lyrics and ideological dispositions." I'll get to that in a moment. 

> **Update**: More than any other part of the guide, this section has seen the most rewriting, because of the rapacious nature of its fans who are sticklers for details. Which is all good, because this guide demands and deserves the utmost scrutiny. It would be great, though, if these same people (you know who you are) would sit and go over everything else I wrote.


While there are many subgenres of Black Metal, they all, or most of them, share common musical traits. These include fast tempos, shrieking vocals, heavily distorted guitars, lo-fi recording (which is really a nice way of saying, "poor production values"), and a preference of atmosphere over technique -- sometimes by means of dissonant chromatic melodies, and at other times by means of keyboards, organ, and choirs. 

Lyrically and thematically, songs often deal with the occult or the metaphysical (especially the metaphysical void or darkness), or sometimes more plainly with Satanism and diabolic perversion. Sometimes, it's about following the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3fzk6O2HS8bKAFAXpH9stR?si=a0b79fd0b89d46de" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>"left-hand path"</span></a> rather than the "right-hand way;" sometimes it's just plain raging against religion, especially against <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6rVuEKrdw2L1YxzCQNbLdK?si=725e50289b9d4045" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Christianity</span></a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/595xEql63Rk4JDe1aH7SFT?si=125f47545af147b3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>the God of the Christians</span></a>. Other times, it's about exploring <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0y7NtErRE91P9U8AUelHGG?si=79c2745aff674565" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Nietzche's Zarathustra</span></a>; still other times, it's about a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/4QmG9mStOfSZDNnzB0IyN9?si=fdef9d6814254467" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>black crow on a tombstone</span></a>. But at any rate, it's always about generating some sense of apocalypse.


In the mid-1980s, and especially in the early-1990s, there were created a few logos that proved seminal in the years to come, most notably the logos of **Mayhem** and **Emperor**. Basically, every Black Metal logo created now takes its cues from both of these. Also, the guy who did the Emperor logo went on to do 10,000(!) logos -- mostly in the Black (and Death) Metal scene.<sup>13</sup> Which is why, regardless of subgenre (Ambient Black Metal, Depressive Suicidal Black Metal, Raw Black Metal, Psychedelic Black Metal, Symphonic Black Metal), Black Metal logos tend to look alike. Indeed, they all share a couple of logo and letter design traits: 

1. The logos often display a **high degree of symmetry**; 
![Black Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-8\black2.jpg)
2. Black Metal logos also often incorporate (background) **graphics of medieval weapons** (swords, axes, maces, flails, shields). It's most likely done to ground the band in History, with a capital H. It's the Black Metal equivalent of opening a new restaurant in 2021 and hanging up a sign that says, "In business since 1991."
![Black Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-8\blackshield.jpg)
3. The logos often feature either **abstract Satanic, occult, or anti-Christian imagery** (inverted crosses, pentagrams, demon and magick sigils) or **figurative graphics pertaining to the dark arts** (candles, wolf heads, goat heads, dragons, daggers, crescents moons) or sometimes both;
![Black Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-8\black4.jpg)
4. The letters are often in **blackletter(-like) form**, either in lowercase or uppercase, with **flourishes (curls and spikes)** and **exaggerated edges**; <!-- Flourishes and exaggerated are commonplace, "with extraneous strokes running parallel, rather than one single stroke." -->
![Black Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-8\black1.jpg)
5. And the logos are often **unreadable** and purposely made to resemble a **lump of tree roots**. To fans of the genre, it signals, "Good luck seeing the forest to the trees." To anyone else, "Good luck finding something -- *anything* -- interesting in this musical mess."
![Black Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-8\black3.jpg)

The Black Metal scene, as we commonly know it today, emerged in Norway in the late-1980s and early-1990s. But the Norwegian bands that made up the scene were actually part of the second wave of Black Metal.

Today, Black Metal is an international phenomenon, and there are many Black Metal doing things differently than the way the bands of the first and second wave did and sometimes still do, both in terms of music and of the ethos of making Black Metal, so it's impossible to cover them all here. But the bands mentioned above, should help get you some idea of how these bands vary in style and intensity.

## Pagan Black Metal
Pagan Black Metal is one of many off-shoots of traditional "mainstream" Black Metal; but whereas it can be difficult to differentiate one subgenre of Black Metal from another, it is very easy to recognize a Pagan Black Metal logo. The one thing that sets them apart from all other subgenres is a high level of **"on-the-noseness,"** with **figurative, arty, romantic graphics** accompanying logos that spell out **"pro-Pagan romanticism,"** stopping short of actually spelling out "We put Paganism on a pedestal."

## Post-Black Metal

Today we see bands that have moved beyond what "traditional" Black Metal is all about. These fall in the genre of Post-Black Metal. (Post-Metal as a genre at large will be discussed below.) For them, it's not about generating a subverse sense of apocalypse, it's about creating abstract soundscapes and dreamy texturalism. It's the sort of music you can put on when it's a lazy Sunday or when having a dinner party, or when you just want to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoegaze" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>gaze at your shoes</span></a>. It's also why Post-Black Metal performers have little reason to don corpse paint. Seriously, why would they? Their presence and their music is so inoffensive they give Milquetoast a run for its money.

Typically, Post-Black Metal logos take the form of **Gothic hand-writing**. It's like someone looked at the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0162661/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Sleepy Hollow logo</span></a> and said, "That right there is what I want."

## Unblack Metal
Seeing how listeners that grew up on, all things considered, mild Heavy Metal were now openly flirting with Satan and his false promises, the Evangelicals knew they had to fight fire with the fire of love, gentleness, and profound wisdom. And so they formed their own bands -- White Metal bands --, with unreserved commitment to try to win back the Metal masses on to the narrow path of virtue and salvation.

The term "White Metal" (or "Christian Metal") is an umbrella term encompassing all of the Heavy and Extreme Metal (sub)genres that deal with Christianity and wholesome living. Here I want to focus on one specific microgenre: Unblack Metal. Bands in this genre emulate their actual and pseudo-Satanic counterparts in everything but personal ideology and religious belief.  

And here's a fun fact for you: Jan Axel "Hellhammer" Blomberg (of **Mayhem** fame) -- yes, *that* Hellhammer -- performed drums on **Antestor**'s 2004 EP *Det tapte liv* and their 2005 full-length album *The Forsaken*.

Logo-wise, it's what you may expect. Logos look like just your average Black Metal logos -- except that the T's look like **upright crosses** instead of inverted ones and naturally it goes without saying that any crosses added to the logo are pictured standing upright.

It's a genre I'm far from familiar with, in part maybe because the term "War Metal" is contested and ill-defined like many genres, which is why musicologists would rather do away with the notion of a "genre" ... but that's a whole different topic for another time and other people. The point of contention is that, according to some, War Metal is basically nothing other than Blackened Death (which wll be discussed below). Others, meanwhile, feel that the term Blackened Death is too broad to be meaningful and that War Metal has its own style and philosophy that sets it apart not just from Blackened Death, but from all subgenres of Black Metal. 

So what is it that makes War Metal (supposedly) unique? Well, it's raw lo-fi and violent. "But isn't all Black Metal raw lo-fi and violent?" No. Yes. But War Metal takes things all the way to the extremes -- of the *extreme*. 

Imagine early-days Thrash and Black Metal being stuck in a loveless relationship. At some point they're like, "Maybe we should spice things up. Let's have a threesome." So then they decide to put out an online ad on an ill-reputable website, because they don't want their friends and coworkers to find out. Years go by without answer ... until finally someone answers. He seems a bit weird and puerile. But beggars can't be choosers. So one night, the couple invites him over. *Why not? We got nothing to lose. It's not like things can get any more stale.* Fast forward nine months, a little hell-maker is making everyone's life miserable. That's War Metal in a nutshell. 

Lyrically and thematically, it's all about war, genocide, nuclear holocaust, Satan and blasphemy, and -- *war*. This is reflected in the genre's visual aesthetics: cartridge belts, gask masks, and goat heads reign here.


Logo-wise, War Metal bands seem to have a thing for **black "negative space" letters** with a **white keyline detail**, giving the whole logo an **embossed effect** illusion. One extra detail to add to the letters are **long, pointed spikes**, or perhaps rather **pointed bullet cartridges**, that protrude from the letters' edges. Together, they give the logo an uneasy impression -- it's as if you're looking at something of the Lovecraftian void; it's not there, yet it is -- when trying to grasp it, it hurts.

<a name="ecumenical"></a>
#### Ecumenical  Metal
Sitting comfortably between the worlds of Black and White Metal, the Occult and Christianity, occupying their own niche genre called Ecumenical Metal, we find **Psalmtanic**. Their music is best described as, "What if we take psalms, preferably the more dark and grim ones lyrically, and give them a metal makeover."<sup>14</sup> It was a success, judging by the several positive Youtube comments on their videos. Lisa Vogel, for example, had this to say:
> "ü§òü§òü§òü§òü§ò. Wundersch√∂n atmosph√§risch,episch ,exzellent .üëçüëåüëåüëå"

And if we can't trust Lisa Vogel, who then can we trust?

Their logo is a tongue-in-cheek riff on the **Emperor** logo, featuring **crosses both upright and inverted**, a **"black hole sun"** and a **white crescent moon** -- as if to metaphorically signal, "Day is night, and night is day" -- and a candle for good measure.

*Full disclosure: I did **Psalmtanic**'s logo. They were the first Norwegian-based band to give me a shot at doing illustrative work. So my hat's off to them.*

# Folk Metal
Closely related to the Pagan Metal is Folk Metal. Where they differ is that while Pagan Black Metal still kinda has the cool factor of Black Metal, Folk Metal has little to no coolness at all, and this shows in the logos. They often take their inspiration from Black Metal aesthetics, with logos made of **lowercase blackletters** or some **Celtic type**, with only **some degree of symmetry** on both opposite ends of the logo, if at all, and even then usually through **decorative curls** rather than through cool letter design.   
![Folk Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-8\folk.jpg)

> **Update**: A friend of mine felt I was too harsh on Folk Metal, so I did what any scientist would do: I gave it another chance. I'm a scientist now, after all -- I mean, I did get a paper published. Anyway. Good science demands honesty. It demands that we suspend judgment until we know the facts. 

> Well now my friend, who is himself a talented musician, made a compelling argument that Folk Metal musicians are often or usually talented in what they do. Sadly, what they do is play Folk Metal. And that brings us back to where we started. A bit of a circular argument, I know, but can you blame me when all I see when I think of Folk Metal are circles and polka dots? In case the joke went over your head: **Finntroll**, one of the first Folk Metal bands to gain international notoriety, play what is often referred to as Polka Metal on account of them integrating *huumpa* (Finnish polka melodies) with Black Metal.

> The thing with Folk Metal is that it juxtaposes acoustic components, i.e. acoustic folk instruments such as violin, accordion, flute, bagpipe, and kantele, with the power and electronic distortion of Heavy Metal. Some people think it's cool and some people don't. (Actually, *most* people don't.) Music critic Scott Seward is one of the former. You ask him and he will tell you that contemporary folk "too often lack the fierceness and meatiness of music born from blood and fire and plague."<sup>15</sup> Meanwhile, listening to a Folk Metal band like **Korpiklaani** sends him "instantly back to a time when trolls ruled the woods." Well I got news for you, Scott. Trolls never ruled the woods. In fact, trolls never even existed! And you call yourself a critic? How about next time you do your due diligence and research your claims! It's what I did and, well -- it persuaded me that my bias was indeed correct. 

> I will say this much, if there's one thing you can count on it's that whoever is playing the accordion, or the violin, is probably a hot smoking babe. (Call me!)


## Folk Metal (Continued)
Some Folk bands take things to the next level by incorporating **viking helmets** and **drinking-horns** in their logos to signal to people, "When you come to our show, you're free to live out your viking fantasy vicariously. By all means, bring your plastic drinking-horn!" And why wouldn't you, if you're a fan of Folk Metal. You've already ostracized yourself from typical metalheads anyway, you may as well commit to the LARP thing.

#### Pirate Metal
Just when the world of Metal was like *no more*, everyone found out that rock bottom has a basement. While some were content with pretending to be Vikings, drinking from plastic drinking-horns while wearing tartan kilts, others got to thinking one day -- *why stop there?* The next logical step was of course to do -- you may have already guessed it -- the pirate thing. 




As you would expect, it's easy to do a Pirate Metal logo. Just do a **skull and a crossbones** logo, and you're golden. You may also think of adding a **falchion** or any other **curved sword** to really drive home that you're fully committed to doing the whole pirate thing.

<a name="crossover"></a> 
# Crossover Genres
When it comes to crossover genres, certain genres, or elements of them, are more likely to "crossover" than others. As it with fashion, so it is with Extreme Metal: Black goes with everything. Indeed, you can find bands that play Blackened Death (**Akercocke**, **Angelcorpse**, **Belphegor**), Blackened Death-Doom (**B√∂lzer**, **Necros Christos**, **Soulburn**), Blackened Speed (**Bulldozer,** **Exorcist**, **Sodomizer**), Blackened Thrash (**Aura Noir**, **Destr√∂yer 666**, **Witchery**), Blackened Grindcore (**Absvrdist**, **Sunlight's Bane**, **Vomit Fist**), Blackened Noise (**Enbilulugugal**, **Gnaw Your Tongue**, **Sutekh Hexen**), Blackened Sludge (**Inter Arma**, **Lord Mantis**, **Tombs**), the list goes on. This actually makes sense when you think about it. 

As has been said above, from the mid-1980s onward and especially in the early-1990s, Black Metal as a genre was obsessed with Satanic imagery in lyrics and therefore often used synonymously to "Satanic Metal" by fans and artists alike because to many of them it really was all about devil worship.<sup>16</sup> Furthermore, a string of church arsons in Norway and incidents of grave robbery throughout Europe -- even in the heart of Heerlen, a small city in the south of the Netherlands --, were not unknown after the emergence of the scene, and all contributed to the cementing of the label and stereotype of "Satanic Metal" in the public conscience.

But of course, no genre holds or can hold a monopoly on the practice of Satanism or any religion. And indeed, plenty of musicians and artists outside of the Black Metal scene are (and have been) sort of interested and entrenched in these things. But the label has stuck, and so now we use "Blackened" as an "adjective-predicate," or a shorthand, for specific non-Black Metal bands and genres that deal on some level with the Occult. 


This doesn't quite work with other genres. The term "Deathened," for example, isn't a generally accepted term. Which is not to say there are no Death Metal-influenced crossover genres; it's just that in these cases, "Death" is used as an adjective or as a limiting genitive. There's Death-Doom, for example, which can be considered as practically a genre in itself and which will be discussed below. 

> **Update**: I could be wrong here. I just googled it and, well -- one review at AngryMetalGuy.com talks about the Deathened Thrash of **Morbid Saint** and Thrashened Death of **Morbid Angel**.<sup>17</sup>

Another example would be Deathrash (**The Crown**, **Legion of the Damned**, **Mortification**). Here I'd say the crossover has more to do with music than the lyrical themes. What's more, one could even go so far as to claim that in this specific case, it's not so much a crossover from one genre to another but just a normal result of "genre-adjacency." After all, Death Metal didn't emerge in isolation, but developed in part out of Thrash in the mid-1980s, and so naturally some bands will fall somewhere on the spectrum between the two. Which is probably why you won't ever hear anyone use the term "Deathtrash." 


And then there's Death 'n' Roll (**The Cumshots**, **Entombed A.D.**, **Helltrain**), which combines Death Metal's trademark vocals and distorted and down-tuned guitars with elements of 1970s Hard Rock.

<a name="bthrash"></a> 
## Blackened Thrash
Blackened Thrash Metal is what you get when Black Metallers want to play something "thrashy" (i.e. getting drunk on beer and **Mot√∂rhead**). When this happens, nine out of ten times they commission someone to basically design them a **Death-Doom-like** logo, but one that features **bat wings** and maybe a **pentagram**, too.

<a name="bdeath"></a> 
## Blackened Death
While "Blackened Death" may seem like a pleonasm, since black is associated with death in most occidental cultures (that's western cultures, you dumbass), the genre divide between Black and Death Metal makes it so that we need a term by which to speak about bands that cross the divide; hence the term "Blackened Death." This paragraph, however, is actually wholly redundant.


Blackened Death Metal is usually straight-up Death Metal, but with lyrics that deal with Satanism and the Occult. The logos reflect just that: often these are **run-of-the-mill Death** logos, with the only difference being the inclusion of, say, an **inverted cross**, a **pentagram**, or **devil horns**.

<a name="deathdoom"></a> 
## Death-Doom 
This extreme subgenre was originally inspired by and birthed out of the Crust Punk scene of the 1980s, most notably but not exclusively in Stockholm, Sweden. It combines the slow tempos and pessimistic, or merely depressive, melodies of Doom Metal with the low, grunting vocals of Death Metal.

Typically, a Death-Doom logo is a **blackletter(-like) wordmark** surrounded with a **white, sometimes jaggy, halo**, and this undoubtedly because -- much like <a href="https://www.metal-archives.com/artists/Martin_van_Drunen/2057" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Martin van Drunen</span></a> -- it just screams, "What are we but mere characters in a negative space."

<a name="deathgrind"></a> 
## Deathgrind
Deathgrind takes the complexity of Death Metal and fuses it with the intensity, speed, and brevity of grindcore; so therefore it makes sense that Deathgrind logos sit somewhere between Death and Grind logos. More concretely, picture stripped-down, simplistic **Death letters** that are overlaid with **splatters and spatters**.  
![Deathgrind](..\assets\img\projects\proj-8\deathgrind2.jpg)

#### Deathgrind (Continued)
* Person A: "Are they a Black Metal band?" 
* Person B: "No, silly. They're a Deathgrind band."

![Deathgrind](..\assets\img\projects\proj-8\deathgrind1.jpg)

If you are anything like Person A, don't feel bad. It's is a very common misconception to mistake a Deathgrind logo for a Black Metal logo. But once you know what to look for and how to interpret it, things because as clear as day to you. 

For starters, Black Metal logos are typically black and (inverted) white in color; this one is colored **green**, a color that is often used by Grindcore (and adjacent) bands. (After all, Grindcore is all about doing things differently, and nothing quite says different like green, which, in terms of pigments, is the opposite of red, the choice color of many bands in the Heavy Metal genre at large.) Another key thing to look out for are signs of **compositional design** -- or, perhaps rather, **lack thereof**. If a logo features a design of intricate, meticulous linework, it's probably *not* a Deathgrind logo.

<a name="industrial"></a> 
# Industrial Metal
As the name suggests, Industrial Metal fuses Heavy Metal and Industrial music, which in itself is a fusion of Rock and Electronic music. This is all very interesting, of course; but what it means for anyone interested in metal logos is that in this genre bands' logos typically have a mechanical look to them. When I say "mechanical," I mean that alone -- **"lifeless, inorganic" letters** (i.e. sharp-edged, blocky, perfectly spaced) that are sometimes tilted 90¬∞ degrees to the left from the horizontal. Furthermore, these logos are often **lettermarks** featuring only bands' initials -- usually in a unique typesetting. But this is difficult to illustrate with a name like **VIS**.

<a name="doom"></a> 
# Doom Metal
Doom Metal is the last major mode of Heavy Metal music. For those not in the know, unlike the other (sub)genres, Doom doesn't really have any unique genre requirements except for this one thing: it has to be ultra-slow.<sup>18</sup> If it's uptempo, it can't be Doom. But it can be anything else. It's as simple as that. Just as simple as that. Anyway, the idea behind this tempo thing is to create a sense of doom or despair. (More like, despairing boredom, amirite?)

This is what makes Doom logo extremely challenging -- challenging for me at least to come up with a genre logo; because it can be so many things depending on a band's specific interests and themes, and they can range anywhere from a dying bride to ... to what exactly? (It's always about some tragic loss of life, isn't it?) To put it bluntly, usually it comes down to throwing shit at a wall and hoping something sticks. (But this is just me talking ... what do I know? I've only worked with a small number of Doom bands.)

<a name="funeral"></a> 
## Funeral Doom
Funeral Doom is characterized by its sloooooow tempos -- slow even for Doom standards. The letters are spaced **miles apart** from each other so as to visually convey the sense of mind-numbing slowness. And because the music doesn't inspire anyone to come up a cool custom design, Funeral Doom bands often have to settle for a **wordmark** with some **decorative curls** that are really only there to signal to the eyes that this or that letter is still very much part of the name and logo.

<a name="psychedelic"></a> 
## Stoner Metal
Because of its slow droning nature, Doom Metal and stoner culture go together like a herb grinder and a glass bong. And so a new genre was born, whose lyrics are often about getting stoned and tripping on acid-laid Kool-Aid.

Logo-wise, nothing quite says stoner and psychedelia like a **hazy** or **cloud-like** Death Metal logo. (No joke -- this one was actually made by mesh-transforming the Brutal Death logo.) To make it further clear that this music is good for intense couch-sitting and bong-ripping, **greens** and **purples** are often used.

<a name="sludge"></a> 
#### Sludge Metal 
Musically, Sludge Metal in many ways is like Stoner Metal, with the only real difference being that Sludge Metal is not about being happily stoned. Quite the opposite, in fact -- its tunes ooze a decadent and depressive atmosphere. In that it's more like the aural equivalent of a bad trip.

In terms of logos, Sludge Metal rather shares similarities with Post-Metal. But this leads to the problem that these logos could look like anything from **hand-lettered comics-type** logos to **contemporary pseudo-art nouveau** logos to **Melodic Death Metal-styled** wordmarks. No, that's not completely true across the board. If it looks like it was drawn by a Parkinson's patient sitting on top of a spinning washing machine -- it's more likely to be a Sludge logo.

<a name="gothic"></a> 
# Gothic Metal
Gothic Metal is a broadly defined genre, comprising of two main subgenres: on the one hand there's bands that grew out of the Death-Doom genre (**Anathema**, **My Dying Bride**, **Paradise Lost**), favoring gloomy, introspective atmosphere over outward bombast, and on the other hand there's melodic symphonic bands that emerged instead from the more uplifting Power Metal (**After Forever**, **Tristania**, **Within Temptation**) and who are really only "Gothic" in dress and name. Below is an example of the former. 

It probably speaks for itself: the lettering style is inspired by a **Gothic** -- which is basically synonymous with **blackletter** -- type. Of course, the astute reader will have noticed that everyone and their mom has blackletter(-inspired) wordmarks for logos. This is indeed a problem for whoever plays in the Gothic genre. The only recourse is to one-up the others by going all-in on the Gothic with yet further **Gothic flourishes**, regardless of whether they add anything of value to the design.

<a name="avantgarde"></a> 
# Avant-Garde Metal
The term "avant-garde" is often used synonymously with "sophisticated." And, certainly, this label holds true for (most) bands playing in this nebulous genre that comprises a range of different (sub)genres. In fact, it comprises of so many heterogeneous (sub)genres that "Avant-Garde" as a genre label has very little meaning aside from, "These guys and gals *really* know how to play their instruments!"

Funnily enough however, whilst Avant-Garde bands most likely, definitely, absolutely display technical virtuosity, they tend to have the least inspired, let alone sophisticated, logos. More than often they have **plain wordmarks**. Even more damning is that they seemingly always have an inexplicable preference for the **Abaddon type** (or something very close to it). But maybe it just came with their Angelfire website and they decided to stick with it ever since.

<a name="post"></a> 
# Post-Metal
Judging by its name you'd think bands in this genre have taken things to the Next Level Beyond Metal. In a way, they have. Seeing what these guys and gals are doing -- it's all very ambitious, it's the next level for the Metalhead who wants to be intellectually challenged. While the plebs are still gushing over **Immolation**'s latest simultaneous(!) callous-shredding guitar leads and legato melodic lines and reveling in **Cannibal Corpse**'s lyrics about necrogenic resurrections, Post-Metallers rather choose to set the tastes of the "thinking man," exploring textures and timbre.

If you're not sure what you're listening to is Post-Metal -- wait until the lyrics kick in. What few there are, are typically interspersed with lecture recordings of Jacques Derrida or more often Michel Foucault. 

A Post-Metal logo could be anything from a casual wordmark to a hand-lettered logo with a more custom and unique feel. Regardless of novelty, Post-Metal logos all have the same letter treatment: they all look like they're **dissolving** or **fading**. Now, mind you, they're not fading out of existence, they're just moving to a higher plain -- and they encourage you to follow them -- to the heights of Reason and Illumination.
![Post-Metal](..\assets\img\projects\proj-8\post2.jpg)

And if the band name consists of several words, the words are set in different sizes of type and placed at different heights from the baseline.

<a name="faux"></a> 
# Faux Metal
If you were born in a white, well-off family in the 1980s or 1990s, chances are you never were into *real*, authentic Metal. While the others were exchanging albums of **Immortal**, **Marduk**, **Nailbomb**, and **Sepultura**, you were probably busy skating in your Droors jeans to the tunes of **Korn**, **Deftones**, and **Coal Chamber**. You probably stood looking surprised, unable to believe that your long-haired classmate just said no to what you thought was a rhetorical question -- "Don't you just wish they had **Limp Bizkit** do a version of *this*!" I hate to break it to you, but you were a poser!

<a name="nu"></a> 
## Nu Metal
I'd rather not waste any words discussing an unseemly genre as Nu Metal, but for clarity's sake, here's what Nu Metal is: it's an eclectic genre that blends elements from Alternative and Groove Metal and a myriad of other styles as well, including but not limited to, Industrial, Hip-Hop, and Funk; vocal styles range from melodic whining to white boy's rap and hysterical screaming; lastly, occasionally turntables and sampling are given more weight than the guitars -- you know, those things whose sound is what give meaning to the term "Heavy Metal."

And what is there to say about Nu logos that has not yet been said by now? They are **puerile in design** and **clumsily drawn**. To its credit in that respect, they convey well what the music is all about.

<a name="metalcore"></a> 
## Metalcore
Metalcore is another one of those "negative synergy" fusion genres that combines the worst elements of Extreme Metal and Hardcore Punk. Still it's what all the cool kids -- and only kids -- are listening to these days so I don't know. (Really, don't ask me why. I'm probably getting old.)

Anyway, the design process of a Metalcore logo can best be described as follows: After a band commissions you to do a logo, you do some preliminary sketching, to get a feel of the band's name, and at some point you probably send them out for approval. Now usually these **preliminary sketches** serve both as the scaffolding upon which the definitive lettering is superimposed and as a guide for any additional typographic style information. But with Metalcore logos, you leave the sketches **"as is."** There is no further work done on the logo.

<a name="nintendo"></a> 
#### Nintendocore
Nintendocore (a term originally, apparently jokingly, coined by Nathan Winneke, lead vocalist of **HORSE the band**) is a derivative form of Metalcore that fuses typical Metalcore elements -- i.e. mosh-friendly breakdowns and the screams of a prepubescent teenager -- with the sound of 1980s chiptune music. In other words, if it were a Jeopardy question, it would be: "What music won't get you laid?"

By having one leg firmly planted in the Metalcore community, whose members are 90 percent male, insofar as we can call angsty emoboys male, and the other resting with fans of 8-bit music, who let's be honest, are most probably Millennial nerds and neckbeards -- this means that the sheer fact of being part of the scene renders one's chances of meeting women at all essentially nil. Indeed, those long entrenched in this microgenre know all to well that Nintendocore really isn't "baby making music." The best one could hope for is a dry hump on the dance floor from a netgeek wearing a fedora.

But I haven't put this guide together just so I could lambast the lifestyles of Nintendocore fans and musicians or ridicule them for their life-decisions. That's only part of it. The other part is that I want to show you how to do a basic Nintendocore logo.

It's quite simple, really. Just download a free font like <a href="https://www.fontspace.com/scream-when-youre-ready-to-die-font-f31092" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Scream When You're Ready To Die</span></a>. Yeah. Yeah, that's a cool 8-bit font, and you see it's perfect because a name like that would also make for a great Nintendocore band name -- perfect in case you were still looking for one. To be sure, you run the risk the font's been overused, so you may want to make some tweaks. I didn't. After doing 50 logos, it's no longer on like Donkey Kong‚Ñ¢. That's right. I'm done and I'm going to do what Nintendon't -- call it quits.

# Cute Metal
Now, before you start jumping up and down, let me say this upfront: Cute Metal is not a thing as such, not an actual genre, no matter how much <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/weeb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>weebs</span></a> try to convince you it is, but more of a description of the type of music and stage shows of cutesy bands from all over the world. I'm not only thinking here of **Babymetal**, who pioneered Kawaii Metal in Japan in the early 2010s, a genre that combines the noisy barrage of Heavy Metal instrumentation with J-pop melodies and idol aesthetics and vocals -- I'm also thinking here of **Charamel**, a Visual Kei band comprised of only *yuru-chara* (i.e. mascot characters), among them internet celebrity **Nyango Starr**, an apple-themed mascot who is one sick drummer. And looking beyond Japan, and if we stretch the meaning of "Heavy Metal" sufficiently, the alternative emos of the Slovakian band **Pentagramƒçek** deserve a mention too. They play Satanic versions of children's songs.
