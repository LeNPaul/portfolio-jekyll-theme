Pagan Black Metal is one of many off-shoots of traditional "mainstream" Black Metal; but whereas it can be difficult to differentiate one subgenre of Black Metal from another, it is very easy to recognize a Pagan Black Metal logo. The one thing that sets them apart from all other subgenres is a high level of **"on-the-noseness,"** with **figurative, arty, romantic graphics** accompanying logos that spell out **"pro-Pagan romanticism,"** stopping short of actually spelling out "We put Paganism on a pedestal."

### Pagan Metal and Viking Metal (continued)

So just what is Pagan Black Metal, you might ask? I'd answer it is Black Metal whose lyrical content usually deals with Germanic Neo-Pagan romanticism -- evoking images of past greatness -- which may raise some eyebrows (in some cases rightfully so). And, compared to conventional Black Metal, the music, which quite often includes folk melodies, is played in a generally slower, but more varying, pace.

If a band's lyrical content deals not so much with Germanic Paganism and its ancient roots, as with Vikings and their deep rooted mythologies, or Nordic ethnic heritage, then you're probably looking at a Viking Metal band. 

But there's a caveat, which concerns the workableness of the genre label "Viking Metal." It's that it's not really workable. The problem is that Viking Metal as a term is so broad; it runs the whole gamut from bands rooted in Black Metal (**Enslaved**, **Helheim**, **Naglfar**) to those who lean more towards Folk Metal (**Einherjer**, **Windir**), to still others who play (Melodic) Death Metal (**Amon Amarth**, **Unleashed**). 

Of course, this means that a Viking Metal logo could look like anything from a **conventional Black Metal logo** to a **Nordic runic inscription**.
