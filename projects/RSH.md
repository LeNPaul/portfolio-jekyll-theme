### Conceptual Render
Based on a napkin sketch provided by the artist, I did an initial logo concept in **Blender**.

### Various Logo Concepts
I then did came up with some new logo concepts.

### Final Logo Concept
Based on the feedback given to me, I did one last logo concept.

### Final Logotype
I then started work on the final -- print-friendly -- logotype.

### Keyline Version
I added a keyline border to make it even more "clean" and readable.

### Two-Dimensional Perspective Render
I also wanted to create a print-friendly version that wasn't so flat. So I rendered the logo in perspective by hand in **Clip Studio Paint**, using the 3D model as a reference.

### Definitive Version
For this final version, I went back to **Blender**. I wrote a custom shader to give the logo a weathered metallic look.
