We all have these moments where we think why not supplement one hobby with another. It's what I did when I realised that 2D and 3D drawing and modelling are not mutually exclusive but in fact are perfectly complementary: using Blender I now often produce models and renders as reference for my drawings. But anyway as it turns out, so too are 3D modelling and making Death Metal. This is proven by **Perilaxe Occlusion**, the only Death Metal band whose lyrics are largely about death and image-based modeling and rendering techniques, because why not? If **Nile** are allowed to write, sing, and nerd about <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/62hzJcOwMg68h6wBimZALA?si=1622e1b4ecef4422" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Egyptian history and mythology</span></a> to their heart's content, if **Fleshgod Apocalypse** are allowed to indite <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3sizVMerlajPegOZWbMKwZ?si=b6fcada8a8c549d3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>a pompous pseudo-intellectual love letter to Greek mythology</span></a>, and if **Carach Angren** are allowed to write lyrics about <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/22mLxdBxBzLAC65fPirK2k?si=8fcb4261bb854615" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>a girl who hastily throws a piece of pie in a plastic bag</span></a>, then anyone can sing about anything at all!

Just by looking at their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CGas6abpA70/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Instagram</span></a>, we can see what went into the making of a Rasterized Death logo. Spoiler alert: it's basically a plain "hollowed out" Death Metal logo covered in webs, drips and yes, polygonal wireframes, because again why not? If you have a gimmick, make sure to use it. Like **Fleshgod Apocalypse** -- if you got a vocalist who can sing a falsetto, you really want him to shove his voice through a mean falsetto on every damn song because that's what the fans want. (No, they don't -- they really don't, so just put a lid on it!)
