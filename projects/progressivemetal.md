What does "Progressive" mean in the context of Metal? Who knows? I sure as hell don't. It could mean anything from "We brought in a saxophonist to record a Metal album with us" to a more general "We march to our own beat" -- which is often to be taken literally: Progressive bands seem to have a weird thing for *syncopation*. 

The question then is how to best represent this visually? It may seem daunting but it is actually quite easy: (1) the letters need to be **tight and bold** and (2) the letters need to be **missing parts**, because this says something about the band's music: "Our music is tight and bold! And it's often difficult to follow and may even end abruptly."
