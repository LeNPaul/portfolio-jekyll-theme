Groove Metal is an off-shoot of Thrash. The riffs are thrashy, but the tempos are slower -- down from 200 to a more danceable 135 beats-per-minutes on average. Of course this all relative, since I've danced to **Emperor**'s "With Strength I Burn" that clocks in at 167 BPM; but you won't ever catch me dancing to, say, **Pantera**'s "Cowboys from Hell" that clocks in at only 115 BPM. 

Because Groove Metal is a softened-up version of Thrash, it's only obvious that bands in this genre have a "softer" logo. And what is softer than a metal? Exactly -- wood. So I gave this one a **wooden finish**. (Honestly, I had no idea what I was supposed to do with Groove Metal. So I took some cues from Pantera and White Zombie and this is what it resulted in.)
