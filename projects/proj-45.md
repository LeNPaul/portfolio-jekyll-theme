#### Tsai Bro Pro Betel Nut Generator: A Tool for Generating Tsai Bro Style Picture

**Yung Ta Lin**, 2019

[**Betel nut**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Areca_nut) is one of the local gum in Taiwan. It is orignated from the aboriginal culture in Taiwan, and it gradually becomes famous across races. The fanpage [**Tsai Bro Pro Betel Nut**](https://www.facebook.com/caigezhuanyebinlangtan/?epa=SEARCH_BOX) was established in Feb, 2016. Tsai Bro (the persona of the fanpage) always stammers out inspiring words using inconsecutive sentence concatenated with ellipsis(...). This reflects a well-known idiom in Taiwan, "挖金憨慢講話，但是挖金實在", which means those poor at speaking speak honestly. Ellipsis implicitly enhances the persuasiveness of the words. In addition, most posts are pictures composed of vivid neon-like colors. This also captured the stereotyped image of betel nut stand. This cult is soonly spreaded in socail network, and people started to mimic this new way of expression. 

Inspired from this phenomenon, I came up with this idea of making a generator to help the trend spread.  

-----
_I designed and implemented it indivisually._

- Inspired from the Facebook fan page “財哥專業檳榔攤”, and try to make the generator. 
- Integrated natural language processing library in node.js server to split Chinese sentence into vocabularies. 
- Implemented output image using canvas and applied Bootstrap grid system. 
- Utilized: Javascript, node.js, HTML/CSS, AJAX, JQuery
