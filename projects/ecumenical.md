Sitting comfortably between the worlds of Black and White Metal, the Occult and Christianity, occupying their own niche genre called Ecumenical Metal, we find **Psalmtanic**. Their music is best described as, "What if we take psalms, preferably the more dark and grim ones lyrically, and give them a metal makeover."<sup>1</sup> It was a success, judging by the several positive Youtube comments on their videos. Lisa Vogel, for example, had this to say:
> "🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘. Wunderschön atmosphärisch,episch ,exzellent .👍👌👌👌"

And if we can't trust Lisa Vogel, who then can we trust?

Their logo is a tongue-in-cheek riff on the **Emperor** logo, featuring **crosses both upright and inverted**, a **"black hole sun"** and a **white crescent moon** -- as if to metaphorically signal, "Day is night, and night is day" -- and a candle for good measure.

*Full disclosure: I did **Psalmtanic**'s logo. They were the first Norwegian-based band to give me a shot at doing illustrative work. So my hat's off to them.*
