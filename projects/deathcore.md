Whenever I see a genre name ending with "-core," I immediately envision who play this genre: angsty 20-somethings with shoulder-length hair that is styled from a side part who for some goofy reason offer standardized Death Metal riffing with a Metalcore twist. Everything about it sucks.

Yes, even the logos suck! (But what else did you expect from guys who think that having a side part is a good look for a guy -- or for anyone, really.) It's like they grew up with post-2000s Tech Death, thinking, hey, this looks cool! This is how a Death Metal logo should look like. (Spoiler: it doesn't.) They differentiate themselves from bands in this genre by how they style the logo: they always do this by adding a drip and sometimes a grainy filter. Oh, and they also like adding an **incongruent symbol**, just because.
