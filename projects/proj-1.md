title: 'Tragic Serenades'
---
I did this logo for a newly-formed gothrock band, featuring some of Norway's best metal talent -- Ã˜rjan "V'Gandr" Nordvik (Helheim, ex-Aeternus), Frode Gaustad (Dominanz, ex-Thy Grief), and Therese "Theto" Tofting (Funeral Void). 

One night the band showed me a napkin sketch and asked it to turn it into a fully designed logo. Once I got back home I did some preliminary sketching in Clip Studio Paint, and then I modelled a "prototype" in Blender. The band wasn't too sure what to make of it, because they felt it looked "too modern." There was no argument there, they play atmospheric (retro) rock in vein of the Cure. So I went back to drawing by hand, and the result was what you see here.
