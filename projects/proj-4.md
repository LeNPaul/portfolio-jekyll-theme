Leap Motion is the state-of-art commercial gesture sensing system which implements in camera-based sensing technique. However, Leap Motion has its limitation on sensing area hinders user from the smooth interaction. To address this issue, we propose Shadow, a low-cost proactive sensing technique that allows sensors one-dimensionally moving and continuously repositioning to keep under the interacting hand. To prove our concept, we built a conveyor belt to shuttle the Leap Motion. Two studies are con- ducted and the results reveal significant improvement in both coverage area and accuracy.

_I'm the first author. I'm resiponsible for the thesis writing, and the hardware part._

- Designed the system including hardware and software. 
- Connected Leap motion (sensor) and step motor (actuator) using Unity 3D and Arduino. 
- Prototyped this concept and Investigated it with qualitative user experiment. 
- Submitted to two conference (AUI and TAICHI), and presented in AUI 2016 (Tokyo University). 
- Utilized: Unity 3D, Leap Motion, Arduino, Research Methods, Thesis Writing, User Experience
