Many parts of classic cars are out of stock, not available - in a worse case, the companies who have produced parts back in the time are even bankrupt, non-existent. Openbimmer is intended to revolutionise the classic car industry by reverse-engineering every part, every line of code of a car.

The effort is high but managable - everyone can contribute and minimise the effort by sharing the designing parts for free.

Openbimmer is the ledger and distributor to collect all parts in one common place and add metainformation like part numbers and supported models. 
On the right you can see a speaker cover of an 1980 BMW 6-series.


openbimmer is hosted on github.
