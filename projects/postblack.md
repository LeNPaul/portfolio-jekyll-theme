Today we see bands that have moved beyond what "traditional" Black Metal is all about. These fall in the genre of Post-Black Metal. (Post-Metal as a genre at large will be discussed below.) For them, it's not about generating a subverse sense of apocalypse, it's about creating abstract soundscapes and dreamy texturalism. It's the sort of music you can put on when it's a lazy Sunday or when having a dinner party, or when you just want to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoegaze" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>gaze at your shoes</span></a>. It's also why Post-Black Metal performers have little reason to don corpse paint. Seriously, why would they? Their presence and their music is so inoffensive they give Milquetoast a run for its money.

Typically, Post-Black Metal logos take the form of **Gothic hand-writing**. It's like someone looked at the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0162661/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Sleepy Hollow logo</span></a> and said, "That right there is what I want."
