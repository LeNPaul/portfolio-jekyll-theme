Power Metal takes its inspiration from both "traditional" Heavy Metal and Speed Metal and fuses the elements therefrom with theatrics and bombast in an effort to create something emotionally impactful and powerful. (More often, however, the result is akin to Wagnerian *bathos*, which is no doubt the reason why Power Metal is only really popular in Germany and German-speaking Europe.) This may be why Power logos are often **rendered in full 3D**, with a **metallic** or **stony texture**. Because, you know, Power Metal is that deep and powerful! Like metal or stone!

Not to be confused with "True Norwegian Black Metal"

claim that their authenticity lies in the idea that they're as extreme as the music and lyrics implied
"real thing" within the culture

true metal is music that's true to the stryle of classic heavy metal
it's not diluted. it's not pussied out. it's not wimped out. it's played from the heart, one hundred per cent.

Wizard are a power metal or “true” metal band known as Germany's answer to Manowar.


although it would be inaccurate to say that the movement doesn't have its share of American fans, power metal is a phenomenon that finds greater favor in europe than in the United States. Power Metal, as performed by bands such as Hammerfall and Jag Pazner, is derived from classic bands such as Dio and Iron Maiden and emphasizes a strong sense of melody and musicianship to accompany its swords-and-sorcery lyrics. It is also referred at times as true metal; some of its most infamous practioners, the members of manowar, are in the habit of proudly proclaiming "death to false metal!" on their website, t-shirts, and albums.<sup>1</sup>

"I believe in the fans, I believe in metal more than anybody you've ever met. And you've known me a long time. I've never pissed on you even though you constantly do it to me. And I don't stab the fan in the back. And another thing, Götz: I'm prepared to die for metal. Are you?"
Götz: Well...

Joey: "Are you prepared to die for metal? Have you ever thought about that? Are you prepared to die for metal?"

Götz: No. I prefer living.

Joey: "But I'm ready! I'm ready to die!"

Götz: Great.

Joey: "Do you want me to prove it?"

Götz: And how would you do that?

Joey: "Do you want to come on stage in Dortmund and shoot me?"

Götz: I wouldn't go that far.

Joey: "Why not?"

Götz: Because I'd prefer it of you'd just play good music.

Joey. "I make good music. I write the best music that I can write and I play the best music I can play. Okay?"

Götz: Okay.

Joey: "I'm preprared to die, remember that. And when you're ready let me know. Write that! Write that I'm ready to die for metal and you're not!"

In the April issue of Germany's Rock Hard magazine (#227 - Christina Scabbia cover shot), editor-in-chief and admitted die-hard MANOWAR fan Götz Kühnemund interviews bassist/founder Joey DeMaio, taking him to task for the band's controversial "performance" at last year's Earthshaker Festival. Kühnemund confronts DeMaio on a number of issues, including Manowar's mid-set soundcheck and using a playback orchestra for part of the show. Following are a series of excerpts from the interview, translated from German:


„I believe in the fans. I believe in metal more than anybody you've ever met. And another thing, I'm prepared to die for metal. Are you?“ - deutsch: „Ich glaube an die Fans. Ich glaube an den Metal, mehr als jeder andere, den Du je getroffen hast. Und noch etwas: Ich bin bereit, für den Metal zu sterben. Du auch?“
