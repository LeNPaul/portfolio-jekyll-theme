Power Metal takes its inspiration from both "traditional" Heavy Metal and Speed Metal and fuses the elements therefrom with theatrics and bombast in an effort to create something emotionally impactful and powerful. (More often, however, the result is akin to Wagnerian *bathos*, which is no doubt the reason why Power Metal is only really popular in Germany and German-speaking Europe.) This may be why Power logos are often **rendered in full 3D**, with a **metallic** or **stony texture**. Because, you know, Power Metal is that deep and powerful! Like metal or stone!

### Power Metal and True Metal (Continued)


As is hopefully clear, this whole guide is a tongue-in-cheek affair. Even so, I don't want to give the impression that I have a strong automatic dislike against Power Metal bands compared to bands in other genres and subgenres, which is why I want to give a German fan of Power Metal the opportunity to make a case for the genre that he grew up with and is a fan of. Therefore, dear reader, let me introduce to you, Bastian Warmduscher, Power Metal fan extraordinaire.

> "Zank you for let-ding me vrite ein bisschen on behalf of zee fans of True Metal, und I respectfully ask zat zeze remarks vill be published vizout editing.

> Zer is ein lot to unpack here. I vill begin by zaying zat, moar zan any ozzer genre/zubgenre schhtyle, only True Metal is zru to zeee schttyle of clazic heaffy metal. It is hauzentic und alvays played from zee heart; it foices zee hineffable in vays vords cannot. It is effery bit as hextreme as zee music und lyrics imply, und above all, it is zee only <strong> real zing</strong> [the bold is the author's, G.] in ein vorld zat is dilooted by vimps and posers.

> You may laugh as much as you vant about zee "svords-und-zorcery" lyrics, chust now. But know zat laughder is ein zign of veakness. You laugh becauze you are unzure of yourself; you laugh becauze you feel ein roosch of glory ven zinking yourself zuperior. But only people vo are unzure of zeir pozizion in life require zuch reazurance. (Zat is vat Hobbes has taught me.)<sup>1</sup>

> But ask yourzelf zis: Are you prepared to die for medal? Haffe you effer zought about zat? Are you prepared to die for medal? I am prepared to die. Und I vould bet mein life on it zat you are not."<sup>2</sup>

> "Thank you for letting me write a piece on behalf of the fans of True Metal, and I respectfully ask that these remarks will be published without editing.

> There is a lot to unpack here. I will begin by saying that, more than any other genre/subgenre style, only True Metal is true to the style of classic heavy metal. It is authentic and always played from the heart; it voices the ineffable in ways words cannot. It is every bit as extreme as the music and lyrics imply, and above all, it is the only <strong> real thing</strong> [the bold is the author's, G.] in a world that is diluted by wimps and posers.

> You may laugh as much as you want about the "swords-and-sorcery" lyrics, just now. But know that laughter is a sign of weakness. You laugh because you are unsure of yourself; you laugh because you feel a rush of glory when thinking yourself superior. But only people who are unsure of their position in life require such reassurance. (That is what Hobbes has taught me.)<sup>1</sup>

> But ask yourself this: Are you prepared to die for metal? Have you ever thought about that? Are you prepared to die for metal? I am prepared to die. And I would bet my life on it that you are not."<sup>2</sup>


Wizard are a power metal or “true” metal band known as Germany's answer to Manowar.

„I believe in the fans. I believe in metal more than anybody you've ever met. And another thing, I'm prepared to die for metal. Are you?“ - deutsch: „Ich glaube an die Fans. Ich glaube an den Metal, mehr als jeder andere, den Du je getroffen hast. Und noch etwas: Ich bin bereit, für den Metal zu sterben. Du auch?“
