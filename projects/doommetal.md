Doom Metal is the last major mode of Heavy Metal music. For those not in the know, unlike the other (sub)genres, Doom doesn't really have any unique genre requirements except for this one thing: it has to be ultra-slow.<sup>1</sup> If it's uptempo, it can't be Doom. But it can be anything else. It's as simple as that. Just as simple as that. Anyway, the idea behind this tempo thing is to create a sense of doom or despair. (More like, despairing boredom, amirite?)

This is what makes Doom logo extremely challenging -- challenging for me at least to come up with a genre logo; because it can be so many things depending on a band's specific interests and themes, and they can range anywhere from a dying bride to ... to what exactly? (It's always about some tragic loss of life, isn't it?) To put it bluntly, usually it comes down to throwing shit at a wall and hoping something sticks. (But this is just me talking ... what do I know? I've only worked with a small number of Doom bands.)
