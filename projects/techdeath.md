A hard-and-fast rule in Death Metal aesthetics is that the more technical the music, the less sophisticated the logo. This is exemplified in Technical Death Metal, a genre whose musicians and artists mix "fast, virtuosic guitar riffs and solos of varying tempos and time signature changes with prevalent drumming and frequent blast beats."<sup>1</sup> It's like they opt to convey an impression of modesty (or perhaps false modesty), often leading to conversations like this:

- "I can play with my eyes closed!"
- "Cool! But did you also have to do that logo with your eyes closed?"

It is worthwhile pointing out here that you can often place a band in this genre somewhere in time just by looking at the band's logo. In the 1990s and before, Tech Death bands had "analogously" hand-drawn logos; post-2000s, these logos have been done mostly digitally -- and it shows.
