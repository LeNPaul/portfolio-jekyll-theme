The term "avant-garde" is often used synonymously with "sophisticated." And, certainly, this label holds true for (most) bands playing in this nebulous genre that comprises a range of different (sub)genres. In fact, it comprises of so many heterogeneous (sub)genres that "Avant-Garde" as a genre label has very little meaning aside from, "These guys and gals *really* know how to play their instruments!"

Funnily enough however, whilst Avant-Garde bands most likely, definitely, absolutely display technical virtuosity, they tend to have the least inspired, let alone sophisticated, logos. More than often they have **plain wordmarks**. Even more damning is that they seemingly always have an inexplicable preference for the **Abaddon type** (or something very close to it). But maybe it just came with their Angelfire website and they decided to stick with it ever since.
