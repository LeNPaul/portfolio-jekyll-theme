Death Metal at large is one of the major "mainstream" modes of Extreme Metal. It's typically characterized by low-tuned, heavily distorted guitars, aggressive, thumping drumming (featuring double-kicks and blast-beats), deep growling vocals, abrupt and complex changes in tempo and time signature ... As a genre, it is very broad, encompassing a great deal of diversity. Indeed, it has spawned several subgenres since its inception in the mid- to late-1980s, all with their own specific iconography.

<script type="text/javascript">
    function toggle_visibility(id) {
       var e = document.getElementById(id);
       if(e.style.display == 'none')
          e.style.display = 'block';
       else
          e.style.display = 'none';
    }
</script>
<a href="#bar" name="bar" onclick="toggle_visibility('foo');">Read more ...</a>
<div id="foo" style="display:none;">
As a general rule it can be observed that in this genre the letters making up the logos tend to be <strong>thick</strong> and <strong>bold</strong> as opposed to, say, the letters making up Black Metal logos. The latter tend to be thin and sometimes somewhat shaky. In that these logos strikingly resemble the fans of these respective genres who are generally respectively heavy set characters and lanky, out-of-sorts pushovers. 
<br><br>
And, contrary to Thrash Metal logos, Death Metal logos tend to have more <strong>"soft" elements</strong>. This, too, makes perfect sense. Thrash gives its fans a linear, myopic view on life in general: it's all about alienation and oppression from a threatening, hostile world of authority -- yet it offers nothing helpful in way of unburdening; meanwhile, ironically, Death offers a more rounded approach to life -- offering a safe, routinized way of exploring things that would terrify or disgust most, which enables a cathartic dissipation of everyday's tension.<sup>1</sup> (I'm not gonna lie -- I really didn't expect to find a source to kinda back this up.)

## Brutal Death Metal
Brutal Death Metal emerged most notably from the 1980s New York Hardcore movement. It's characterized by its thumping heaviness, high-speed power chording and riffing, and overall complex rhythms. As a rule, their lyrics deal with slasher movies and True Crime, and this is often reflected in their choice of logos. These typically incorporate **gore elements** (e.g., bones, intestines, and blood), sometimes to the point where the entire logo exactly resembles a jigsaw puzzle of bones dripping blood.
