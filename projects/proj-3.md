A simple app to pick out colors using RGB values.

This app is **not** super complex, or even that great, but it was my first attempt at SwiftUI
without any real training. It is the result of many hours on Stack Overflow, and it is unique
in that I even fully assembled the images it needed to be put on the App Store. Obviously it
didn't make it through the review process, but it was nonetheless an exciting project for me
at the time, and all around a great learning experience.

Now it lives in this Github Repository [here](https://github.com/zobiejrz/color).
