For a sort of 'Hello World' for Swift 4, I built a game of Pong for Mac. Nothing
to difficult, but it gave me a good introduction to Xcode.

I didn't make a playable version readily available, but feel free to visit the
[repository](https://www.github.com/zobiejrz/ping-pong) and play with it locally.
