My first attempt at a Minecraft server plug-in.

This project was a pretty simple Java project, but ended up being loads of fun to write. After dying *many* times
far from my bed on my friends server, I decided the only rational thing (after rage quitting of course)
was to code my own plug-in to put player items into a chest on their death so nothing gets lost!

It has some good configuration support so the server admins get to customize some things on their end.

It wasn't really meant to be for the public at large, so I keep it [here](https://github.com/zobiejrz/SafeDeathPlugin).
