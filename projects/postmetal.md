Judging by its name you'd think bands in this genre have taken things to the Next Level Beyond Metal. In a way, they have. Seeing what these guys and gals are doing -- it's all very ambitious, it's the next level for the Metalhead who wants to be intellectually challenged. While the plebs are still gushing over **Immolation**'s latest simultaneous(!) callous-shredding guitar leads and legato melodic lines and reveling in **Cannibal Corpse**'s lyrics about necrogenic resurrections, Post-Metallers rather choose to set the tastes of the "thinking man," exploring textures and timbre.

If you're not sure what you're listening to is Post-Metal -- wait until the lyrics kick in. What few there are, are typically interspersed with lecture recordings of Jacques Derrida or more often Michel Foucault. 

A Post-Metal logo could be anything from a casual wordmark to a hand-lettered logo with a more custom and unique feel. Regardless of novelty, Post-Metal logos all have the same letter treatment: they all look like they're **dissolving** or **fading**. Now, mind you, they're not fading out of existence, they're just moving to a higher plain -- and they encourage you to follow them -- to the heights of Reason and Illumination.

And if the band name consists of several words, the words are set in different sizes of type and placed at different heights from the baseline.
