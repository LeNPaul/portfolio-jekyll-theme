***TMI WARNING!!!*** 

This warning may be a bit late in the guide, but you should use caution in allowing your youngsters or colleagues to see you reading this.

Some people suggested I should add some distinct subgenres of Grindcore. There are quite a few, such as Goregrind (**Cliteater**, **Haemorrhage**, **General Surgery**) and Cybergrind (**Cutting Pink with Knives**, **Genghis Tron**, **iamerror**), but here I'll focus only on Porngrind, a microgenre that is fixated on, as you may have already surmised, pornographic lyrical themes. 

Understand that the reason I picked this one out is only because I've already had the dubious honor of doing a Porngrind logo years ago (don't ask!) and I was able to use that one as a base to draw upon. I think the logo speaks for itself so that I need not elaborate on it.

*Due to the graphic NSFW nature of the sample logo, we thought it best to **not** display the sample logo in full-frame view, but for those interested, you can see it* <a href="..\assets\img\projects\proj-8\porngrind.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>*here*</span></a>.

It's a genre so base and vile, you won't be able to find most bands on Spotify. Luckily, there's still Youtube ...
