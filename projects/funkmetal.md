Funk Metal is one of those late-1980s and early-1990s fusion experiments that never quite caught on -- though some bands did actually gain mainstream popularity -- either then or eventually, but really only when they moved toward more mainstream-friendly fare. One can think here for example of **Living Colour**, **Primus**, **Rage Against the Machine**, and **Red Hot Chilli Peppers**. 

As a genre it blends together "the distinctive sound of funk" and "conventional riffing [of] 1980s thrash metal."<sup>1</sup> But the logos hardly reflect the latter. With maybe one exception (**Infectious Grooves**), no Funk Metal act has a logo that looks anything remotely like one that belongs to a Heavy or Extreme Metal band -- in fact, most of the time they have a logo design that seemingly took its inspiration from **Rugrats**, **Aaahh!!! Real Monsters**, or **Duckman**, which is unlikely seeing how they respectively premiered in 1991, 1994, and 1997. (Oh, and when I say most of the time, I'm really just saying ... just one out of ten.)
