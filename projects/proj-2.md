My own game of minesweeper built using SwiftUI

After spending time doing the Stanford CS192p class [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/jbtqIBpUG7g),
I wanted to excercise some of my new skills with my own project! I hope to make this my first
app on the app store, but I definitley have a bit to go before I can make that a reality.

You can check out this Github Repository [here](https://github.com/zobiejrz/minesweeper).
