title: '100 Days of Code'
---

For the 2020 New Year I committed to doing 100 Days of Code!
<br><br>
Because I can't be sure I'll have a separate side project for all 100 days,
I made a Github repository I plan on filling with programming problems that I find on the internet.
<br><br>
To track my progress, check my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zobiejrz){:target="_blank"}
and the [Github Repository](https://github.com/zobiejrz/100DaysOfCode){:target="_blank"}
for this goal.
