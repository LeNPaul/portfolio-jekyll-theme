_This is my first independently developed game in [GaussToys Inc.](www.gausstoys.com), that I designed the process, the visual elements and writing the code._

- Developed a digital board game on tablet using GaussSense. 
- Illustrated all UI elements using Adobe Illustrator and implemented using Unity 3D.
