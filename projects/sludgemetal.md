Musically, Sludge Metal in many ways is like Stoner Metal, with the only real difference being that Sludge Metal is not about being happily stoned. Quite the opposite, in fact -- its tunes ooze a decadent and depressive atmosphere. In that it's more like the aural equivalent of a bad trip.

In terms of logos, Sludge Metal rather shares similarities with Post-Metal. But this leads to the problem that these logos could look like anything from **hand-lettered comics-type** logos to **contemporary pseudo-art nouveau** logos to **Melodic Death Metal-styled** wordmarks. No, that's not completely true across the board. If it looks like it was drawn by a Parkinson's patient sitting on top of a spinning washing machine -- it's more likely to be a Sludge logo.
