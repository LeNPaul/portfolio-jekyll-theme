As the name suggests, Industrial Metal fuses Heavy Metal and Industrial music, which in itself is a fusion of Rock and Electronic music. This is all very interesting, of course; but what it means for anyone interested in metal logos is that in this genre bands' logos typically have a mechanical look to them. When I say "mechanical," I mean that alone -- **"lifeless, inorganic" letters** (i.e. sharp-edged, blocky, perfectly spaced) that are sometimes tilted 90Â° degrees to the left from the horizontal. Furthermore, these logos are often **lettermarks** featuring only bands' initials -- usually in a unique typesetting. But this is difficult to illustrate with a name like **VIS**.
