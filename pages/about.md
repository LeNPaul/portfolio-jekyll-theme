# Tundra Toucan
I never dreamed of becoming a metal designer and illustrator. I only got into it after being snubbed by a local band from the Netherlands who felt my work was not symmetrical enough to be labeled "trve." 

Over the years, I've had the honor and pleasure to work with many talented bands and musicians from all over the world, including, amongst others, [Dauthuz](https://www.facebook.com/dauthuzdeathmetal/about/), [Funeral Void](https://fvneralvoid.bandcamp.com/), [Ghostheart Nebula](https://ghostheartnebula.bandcamp.com/), [Intero](https://intero.bandcamp.com/), [Psalmtanic](https://psalmtanic.bandcamp.com/), and [Toxocara](https://toxocara.bandcamp.com/).

If I'm not working on a commission, then I'm working on my own science fiction comic book.  

Thanks for showing interest in me and my work.
