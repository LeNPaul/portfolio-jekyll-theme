#### Yung Ta Lin (Lynda Lin)
I've been enthusiatic in making something visible and having interaction with people. 
That's why I did Human Computer Interaction (HCI) research in graduate school, and I did my first job in [GaussToys Inc](http://gausstoys.com/).
Now, I'm looking forward to explore more on front-end, or application engineer positions.  
<br>
Besides technology, I also have great passion in art and design (check my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ynda.lyn/) below). 
In the future, I expect myself to be the role who bridge the art and technology and make something impressive.
