My name is Gerrit Rijken. I'm originally from a small city in the Netherlands but now living the dream in Bergen, Norway, "the cradle of Black Metal."

After graduation from high school, I entered the Erasmus University Rotterdam to study history. I got my bachelor's and then did some teaching. Within a few months, I learned that it wasn't my vocation to deal with young people and youth. So I quit and pursued other plans.

Now, after years of operating as a semi-professional illustrator creating logos and T-shirt designs for bands mostly, I'm hoping to become a full-fledged professional. And to that end, I've enrolled in the University of Bergen to study Visual Communication.

What else ...? When I'm not working on a commission or a study assignment, then I'm usually working on my own science fiction comic book.

<!-- # My Process
Here's how I typically work. First, I ask you what kind of design you have in mind. Then I'll do some sketches and send them your way, and you can choose which design you favor. 

If you go over to my [Behance](https://www.behance.net/tundratoucan) profile, you can find some step-by-step demonstrations from early sketches to finished works, which will give you an idea of my design process in action.

As payment for my services I ask a flat fee of 2000 NOK/200 EUR/200 USD, whether a logo or T-shirt art, with 50% of the amount paid upfront **before start of the project**.<sup>1</sup>

# Get in Touch!
If you're interested in a collaboration or commission, or would just like to talk art and logos, [get in touch](../contact)!

##### [1] The fee amount and upfront percentage are somewhat flexible (depending on the scope and complexity of requirements). -->
