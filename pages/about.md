# About me
After graduation from high school, I entered the Erasmus University Rotterdam to study history. I got my bachelor's and then did some teaching. I learned early on that it wasn't my vocation to deal with young people and youth. So I quit and decided to try to make it as an illustrator. 

Now, years later, I've had the honor and pleasure to work with many talented bands and musicians from all over the world, including, amongst others, [Dauthuz](https://www.facebook.com/dauthuzdeathmetal/about/), [Funeral Void](https://fvneralvoid.bandcamp.com/), [Ghostheart Nebula](https://ghostheartnebula.bandcamp.com/), [Intero](https://intero.bandcamp.com/), [Psalmtanic](https://psalmtanic.bandcamp.com/), and [Toxocara](https://toxocara.bandcamp.com/).

# About my work
If you go to my [Behance](https://www.behance.net/tundratoucan) profile, you can find several more designs, sketches and works-in-progress.

If I'm not working on a commission, then I'm working on my own science fiction comic book.  

# Closing words
Thanks for showing interest in me and my work.
