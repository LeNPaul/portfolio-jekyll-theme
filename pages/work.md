# What's Up?
Looking for a new logo for your Black Metal band? Or are you shopping for T-shirt art to promote your Death Metal band? Great! I can help you with that.


# My Process
Here's how I typically work. First, I ask you what kind of design you have in mind. Then I'll do some sketches and send them your way, and you can choose which design you favor. 

If you go over to my [Behance](https://www.behance.net/tundratoucan) profile, you can find some step-by-step demonstrations from early sketches to finished works, which will give you an idea of my design process in action.

Throughout this process I will keep you posted on the progress -- explaining what I'm doing, taking in feedback and making adjustments if desired.

# Quid Pro Quo
As payment for my services I ask a flat fee of 2000 NOK/200 EUR/200 USD, whether a logo or T-shirt art, with 50% of the amount paid upfront **before start of the project**.<sup>1</sup> 

Upon final payment, I'll send you a link to a folder containing a collection of high-resolution images in different formats.


# Get in Touch!
If you're interested in a collaboration or commission, or would just like to talk art and logos, [get in touch](../contact)!
